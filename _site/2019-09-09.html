    <p>Dear Journal,</p>

<p>Good morning everyone! It’s so dark in the mornings now. With all the
rain clouds still hiding the morning sun, it feels like I woke up in the
middle of the night, and it’s making me want to crawl back into bed for
a few more hours, even after finishing this coffee. But little does my
body know that it’s actually 7 AM on Monday morning, and it’s time to
roll.</p>

<p>Last night, I tried to make pea soup. It was also cold and drizzly
yesterday, and I pictured us sitting on the back porch under the
umbrella - maybe under a few blankets - eating hot pea soup. But that
never happened, I sort of botched the recipe. For some reason, the peas
cooked, but they never dissolved into a puree, even after boiling the
hell out of them for the last half hour. I finally declared the recipe
edible by 8 PM, but by then I had already lost my temper and we didn’t
feel like eating outside.</p>

<p>I lost my temper. Still trying to figure that out. I stopped keeping an
anger journal a few months ago because I was pretty satisfied with the
revelation that I lack patience, and that leads to outburts, but I
decided that just knowing the problem is isn’t enough to fix it. I need
to practice. So I created an “Anger” section in my notes and kicked
things off with the great Sunday night pea soup meltdown.</p>

<p>After dinner, I hung out with Marissa in the dining room while she put
the finishing touches on some pieces. Today she’s sending a bunch of her
paintings to be put on display at a restaurant in Rochester. Our dining
room looks like a very compact art gallery - all the finished pieces
propped up on display.</p>

<p>I tried working on some code. I wanted to play around with setting up a
server in google cloud, but google cloud was being stupid, and after
getting all wound up over dinner I knew I wouldn’t have the patience to
deal with it, so I shut the laptop and just decided to binge some
cooking videos on YouTube. And I’m glad I did - I picked up a lot of
good tips and recipes I’d like to try, including a bacon &amp; asparagus
dutch baby. Oh yeah, you heard me right. This is a dangerous for our
family. Once we make a <em>savory</em> dutch baby, that opens a door into a
universe where we eat several dutch babies per day. In the morning we’ll
eat a classic breakfast dutch baby, then for lunch maybe a pizza calzone
version, and then for dinner, maybe a rustic french style hunter’s
trilogy dutch baby. Of course we’d make another dutch baby just before
bed as a snack. Of course I kid. Tonight we’re going to try out this
asparagus bacon version. It doesn’t get coated in powdered sugar, so it
plates up more like a puffy quiche, and that’s not a very controversial
choice for dinner, is it?</p>

<p><em>Sip.</em> We’re going on four days without a coffee maker. We’re scraping
by with the french press, but I’ve forgotten how cold and gritty it gets
toward the bottom. Additionally, prepping a french press before going to
bed is much less satisfying then prepping a coffee maker.</p>

<p>So what else is going on. Ah, I’m on ticket duty this week. I’m mentally
revving up to be very attentive and proactive with helping people today.
Which is good, I have some podcasts to catch up on, and that makes the
day go by pretty quickly. I haven’t checked in on my regular podcasts in
a while, but I ran out of music to listen to and feel like changing
things up. Last night while doing the dishes I listened to Uhh Yeah
Dude. I like the podcasts that are loyal to a certain format, because
when you pick them up again it feels like you never left.</p>

<p>Man, this morning I feel like I’m really squeezing my brain to get the
words out. I guess I’m having kind of a mentally quiet morning. And
that’s OK, there’s a time and a place for every way you feel. Maybe
you’re having a quiet morning too, and this morning you don’t feel like
bursting through the doors at work with a big smile on your face like
you’re running for office or something. Maybe it’s the kind of morning
where you’ll just grab a cup of coffee, get under a pair of headphones,
and get to work until lunch.</p>

<p>No matter how you feel this morning, I hope you have a good day. If
you’re with me and you’re feeling quiet, let’s use the time to mentally
charge up and reflect. Hope you all have a wonderful Monday morning.</p>
