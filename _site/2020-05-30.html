    <p>Dear Journal,</p>

<p>Good morning, everyone!  How are you feeling today?  I’m moving pretty
slowly this morning.  Remember that bottle of port I was so excited
about?  Well, I did solid work last night putting away most of the
bottle, and this morning I have a metaphorical axe wedged in my
forehead, but it’s nothing that hot coffee and a cheesy, greasy
breakfast can’t fix.</p>

<p>At the moment, Rodney and I are hanging out on the couch watching
<em>Dude Perfect</em>, and the only thing still stealing my focus from
reflecting on yesterday is a web chat I have open with Google’s
customer support about the new phones Marissa and I ordered.</p>

<p>“Sir, I have a package that was delivered to you at [my old
Schaumburg address],” a lady at FedEx told me yesterday over the
phone.</p>

<p>“HA!” I laughed haughtily.  “I haven’t lived there in a while, whoever
sent that package is clearly lost.  Just send it back to them!”</p>

<p>It turns out the lost package I was mocking contained our new phones,
and I hadn’t updated my address in the Google store.  Looks like I’ll
be rocking the cracked screen Moto X for another week.</p>

<p><em>Sip</em>.  The phone shipping mix-up is just a small hiccup in an
otherwise wonderful weekend.  We had a wonderful day yesterday.  In
the morning, I had no trouble getting Rodney out of bed.  We had an
exciting adventure planned.</p>

<p>“Dude, today we’re going to the grocery store,” I said after shuffling
into his bedroom.  Rodney sprang up, threw on a new outfit, and soon
the two of us were huddled around a sheet of paper, penning a grocery
list.</p>

<p>“Cheese, chicken breasts, cream… some stock…,” I muttered to
myself.</p>

<p>“Mac ‘N Cheese, <em>crappy</em> bars, <em>pahtrol</em> fruit snacks,” said Rodney,
trying to complete my thought.  I nodded, pretending to write down his
items as well.</p>

<p>Aside from a short stay at a friend’s house while we were having
Miles, Rodney hadn’t been anywhere since the quarantine started, and
he was still feeling iffy about wearing a face mask.  In all the
conversations we had priming him for the first comeback grocery trip,
Rodney seemed to think that he could wear his bike helmet instead.</p>

<p>“And you’re going to wear your mask, right dude?”  I asked as we
strapped our shoes on.</p>

<p>“Wear mask later.  I can wear my helmet,” said Rodney.</p>

<p>“No dude, no helmet.  It’s gotta be your mask,” I said assertively.
Rodney sighed, and stuffed his little face mask in his back pocket
before we slipped out the back door.</p>

<p>A few blocks before reaching the grocery store, Rodney piped up,
raising his voice over our quiet summer tunes.</p>

<p>“Hey, <em>Peter Parker</em>,” he said.  “I try mask on.”  I gave him a quick
thumbs up over my shoulder while waiting at the stop light.</p>

<p>Our shopping trip was incredible.  Rodney was so happy to be back at
Hy-Vee that he pretty much forgot he was wearing a mask.  He was more
concerned about crossing everything off on our grocery list.</p>

<p>Out of gratitude for his good behavior, I bought pretty much
everything Rodney pointed at.  With our usual grocery haul, we picked
up a new red ball and a chocolate egg.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” he said to the cashier as she printed our
receipt.  I could see the cashier’s cheek bones form a smile from
behind her black cloth mask.</p>

<p>“You’re so cute,” she said.</p>

<p>I was impressed.  Even after a few months apart from our grocery
shopping ritual and coming back to a very different looking Hy-Vee,
Rodney still remembered everything.  The world’s best shopping buddy
was out of retirement with very little dust to shake off.</p>

<p>“Rodney is in such a good mood,” said Marissa, beaming with delight as
we picked over leftovers for lunch.  “He hasn’t watched TV all
morning, and he’s been really well-behaved.  I think that grocery trip
made a huge difference in his day.”</p>

<p>And yesterday was a first for Marissa as well.  In the afternoon, she
took a quick run to the nearby flower store to pick up some plants for
our backyard.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t very busy, so that was good,” she recounted.  “Waiting in
line is the worst.  The line is so much longer and more daunting,
since everyone is standing six feet apart.”</p>

<p>She and Rodney set up the new haul of plants on the deck while I
prepared dinner.  She picked up some basil, cherry tomatoes, rosemary,
thyme, parsley, celery, and most exciting of all, a new lemon tree.</p>

<p>Rodney, still riding the high from a successful grocery trip in the
morning, was relentlessly helpful.  He helped Marissa pack soil around
the plants in new pots, stopping only when he tragically got a speck
of dirt lodged in his eye.</p>

<p>For dinner, I took a page from my French cooking class and prepared a
<em>Poulet Creme Champignons</em>, or a seared chicken breast in a creamy
mushroom pan sauce.</p>

<p>“It’s beautiful,” said Marissa snapping a photo of the finished
ensemble.</p>

<p>“You know what’s weird?  It wasn’t much work,” I chuckled.  “It looks
amazing, but I spent most of the time just watching you guys work on
the plants out the window.”</p>

<p>“Dude - “, I said turning to Rodney.  “What got stuck in your eye?
That looked like a big fiasco.”</p>

<p>“Yeah!” replied Rodney.  “<em>wannna wanna dayys</em>,” he said with a shrug.
That’s his new seasonal indecipherable filler phrase, and from what we
can tell, it means <em>Yeah, what are you gonna do, right?</em></p>

<p>After a short walk around the block, I put Rodney to bed.  “We’re
going to try something a little different tonight, dude,” I said as he
sat on the couch taking a few final swigs of milk.  “Everything is all
ready for you - I laid out your pajamas and put some toothpaste on
your toothbrush.  You’re going to get yourself ready, then call me up
when you’re ready for a story.”</p>

<p>Rodney disappeared upstairs, and Marissa and I listened with amusement
to the thumping and rustling in his room.  Minutes later, Rodney’s
small voice called me upstairs.</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” I said pacing into the bathroom for an inspection.
“Toothbrush is wet, there’s some pee in your toilet.  Pajamas are on.
Dude I think you got everything - <em>A+</em>.”</p>

<p>Rodney clapped his hands.</p>

<p>“Ope, but what about the pull-ups?” I said interrupting his victory
dance.  Rodney speedily lifted his shirt, flashing the waist band of
his new diaper.  The label peeking out of his pajama shorts read
<em>BACK</em>.”</p>

<p>“OK, <em>A minus</em>.  The pull-ups are on backwards,” I laughed.</p>

<p>Have a great day today, everyone.</p>
