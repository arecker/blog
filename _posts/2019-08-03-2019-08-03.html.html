<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, and happy Saturday to everyone!  Last night was as
  mellow as it could be, and exactly what I needed after a long work
  week.  After making our usual Friday night pizza, I put Rodney to bed,
  packed up some leftovers, then Marissa and I climbed under a blanket
  and watched New Girl.  I entered a deep state of coziness, keeping my
  neck and back perfectly straight and not moving any of my limbs.  I
  felt like I was in a deep sleep, only with the added bonus of getting
  to watch TV instead of dream, and occasionally laugh aloud.</p>
<p>We emerged from our TV watching cocoon sometime around 12:30PM and
  immediately sauntered upstairs to bed.  This morning, feeling utterly
  refreshed, I jumped out of bet a little earlier than usual so I could
  clean up after dinner and make breakfast.  I attempted to make a Dutch
  Baby, which wasn&#8217;t nearly as perilous as I expected.  I clarified some
  butter, whipped up a quick batter in a blender, then poured the batter
  into the center of a hot cast-iron pan.  The batter and butter hissed
  angrily, and it reminded me of the scene from the Wizard of Oz where
  (spoiler alert) the witch melts.  A hot, evil, wet mess went into the
  oven, but twenty minutes later it was a golden brown, doughy
  breakfast-flavored cloud.  Completely on par with all of Chef John&#8217;s
  recipes, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyxEFj7bgHI">Dutch Baby recipe</a> was fool-proof, and an instant
  favorite.</p>
<p>Rodney, Marissa, and I ate breakfast at the table, then made our way
  to the couch to watch some cartoons.  After a quick journal entry, I&#8217;m
  going to shower, then take Rodney out to grab some lunch and some
  groceries.  Marissa was stuck with him all day yesterday at her
  agility trial (which Ziggy absolutely nailed - two qualifying runs in
  one day!), so we agreed to fit as much dad time in today as possible.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a Saturday.  Make a dutch baby, watch some cartoons, and go
  for a walk.  We can clean up the kitchen later, there&#8217;s no hurry.</p>
