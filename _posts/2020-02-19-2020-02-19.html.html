<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.  Thanks for stopping by this Wednesday
  morning.  As this February plunges us back into the depths of winter
  with harsh winds and freezing temperature, I hope you&#8217;re still
  managing to stay warm.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling good today.  This morning I brewed a double batch of
  coffee, I skipped showering, and wardrobe wise I&#8217;m shooting for
  maximum comfort and minimal presentation.  I&#8217;m ready to hunker down
  and have a productive remote day.</p>
<p>Yesterday was productive as well.  When I get to work in the mornings,
  I usually spend the first half hour of my day making a list of things
  I&#8217;d like to accomplish, but for the first time yesterday I assigned
  times to work on things as well.  I planned the whole day out - work,
  lunches, breaks, and walks - all the way until quitting time.  Setting
  aside time to work on something makes a huge difference, and I
  couldn&#8217;t recommend it more.</p>
<p>I worked on code all morning, then for lunch, walked over to the
  novelty cheese shop on the square to pick up a sandwich.  I cut the
  big sandwich in half, bagging the other half to take home later, and
  plated it up with some pita chips, a fun sized snickers bar, and a
  diet coke, taking the plate over to my desk to dine while catching up
  on YouTube videos.</p>
<p>After finishing my lunch, I relocated to a chair in the kitchen to
  read up on some documentation.  I was supposed to do research on
  another team&#8217;s solution for something my team was building, but I went
  down a bit of a rabbit hole skimming through the rest of their
  documentation.  It&#8217;s amazing how differently other teams at the same
  company can operate.  Later in the afternoon, my manager pulled up a
  chair next to me, spending a coffee break chatting with me about what
  I was reading.  &#8220;I&#8217;m overwhelmed,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot more
  information here than I thought there would be, just slowly taking it
  in, ya know?&#8221;  Heath sleepily nodded, taking another sip of coffee
  before heading back to his desk.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, I got up to take a long walk around the
  square.  It was chilly outside.  The wind was picking up, and the
  ground was still wet from melting snow, but it felt good to get
  outside and stretch my arms and legs.  I walked around the square and
  up by the terrace.  I spent a few minutes throwing snowballs off the
  balcony, trying to land one in the lake.  It&#8217;s much further than it
  looks.</p>
<p>At quitting time, I wrapped up my TODO list, and concluded the day by
  re-watching a recipe video for tomato bisque while making a grocery
  list.  I jumped on a bus home, finding Marissa on the couch.  She had
  a bad day - some lady at Home Depot made a passing comment that bummed
  her out, so I was eager to get Rodney out of the house and give her
  some alone time.</p>
<p>From the back seat of our car, Rodney brought me up to speed with his
  day - everything he could still remember, coming out of his deep
  afternoon nap, anyway.  At Hy-Vee, he helped himself to one of the
  free bananas they set out for kids, but after taking three bites, he
  decided he didn&#8217;t want it anymore.  I finished eating it by default as
  we picked up canned tomatoes, sourdough bread, and vegetables.</p>
<p>At the checkout aisle, I asked Rodney to take the banana peel to the
  garbage.  Rodney dutifully nodded and slipped through the queue of
  shoppers to the customer service counter, where there is usually a
  little plastic garbage can.  The garbage wasn&#8217;t there today.  Rodney
  stood in a circle and spun, before spotting a garbage further back by
  the doors.  He ran over, stuffed the peel in the garbage, then turned
  to face the aisles.  Our eyes met, Rodney waved, then he ran back to
  meet me.  Waving at me before rejoining me in line was actually his
  contribution to this ritual.  Rodney adapts to new responsibilities
  well.  Even in something as silly as throwing a banana peel away in
  the grocery store, it&#8217;s fun to stand back and watch him relish in the
  independence.</p>
<p>After unloading the groceries at home, I got to cutting vegetables and
  simmering the soup base in the kitchen.  Marissa climbed off the couch
  and joined me in the kitchen to talk, venting about her frustration
  with the day.  As she reflected, I offered her off-cuts of the Irish
  cheddar I was grating for the grilled cheese sandwiched we&#8217;d eat with
  our tomato soup.  She appreciated the listening ear, and I appreciated
  the company.</p>
<p>We ate dinner at the table.  The grilled cheese sandwiches, which had
  cheese melted on the inside and crisped on the outside, were another
  effortless success thanks to my favorite new nonstick pan.</p>
<p>After dinner, we put Rodney to bed, then go to work in the basement.
  Marissa was laying down self-leveling concrete.  We had done two bags
  the night before, and being more familiar with the process (and armed
  with a mixing drill attachment dug out of Marissa&#8217;s old resin gear),
  were much more efficient.  While Marissa dumped the concrete and
  spread it with a squeegee, I&#8217;d fetch a bag of concrete from the car
  and 5 quarts of water in a bucket.  I&#8217;d cut the bag while she mixed
  the solution, then we&#8217;d repeat.  We dumped six bags of concrete on the
  basement floor.  It was gratifying watching the smooth, grey paste
  fill in the cracks and scratches of the basement floor.  It moved and
  blended like a french paste, or that quick hardening chocolate you
  pour over icecream.</p>
<p>Exhausted, and still covered in concrete dust, we sealed off the
  basement before heading upstairs to finish chores.  At 11, I grabbed a
  beer out of the fridge and Marissa joined me on the couch with the
  other half of the sandwich I bought for lunch.  I was feeling sore, in
  the good way.  Nothing makes you feel more deserving of a beer than
  moving bags of concrete around.</p>
<p>Hope you have a wonderful day today.  I&#8217;m going to go hang out
  downstairs with the Rodman and make a list of what I&#8217;d like to
  accomplish today.  Thanks for reading, and happy Wednesday.</p>
