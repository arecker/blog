<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone, and happy Thursday.  The weather has been so
  interesting this week in Madison.  For the most part, it&#8217;s been
  gloomy.  The mornings and evenings are dark, and we&#8217;ve had some rain,
  but there&#8217;s also lots of sun peeking through the clouds, making for
  some very dramatic skies.  There&#8217;s lots of angst in the air.</p>
<p>Work continues to get a little dicey.  The other day, I compared
  working incidents to being on a crack IT fire fighting team, but
  yesterday it felt like I started work and the fire department was on
  fire.  We had a handful of incidents throughout the day.  After
  Marissa got back from dog practice, our services were still pretty
  unstable and I was too nervous to go anywhere for lunch, so we heated
  up some leftover rigatoni while I continued working.  I still had a
  beer - that&#8217;s a staple for Wednesday lunch.</p>
<p>Outages suck.  When we have a bad week, the hardest part is having to
  set aside your work routine.  I&#8217;m used to a weekly rhythm.  But when
  you have a few incidents in a row, the meetings and rituals you&#8217;re
  used to are replaced with marshal law in which you just have to be
  ready for anything.  That&#8217;s made it a challenging week, both
  technically and emotionally.  I was talking with Marissa on the porch
  last night, and coincidently she&#8217;s had kind of a tough work week too.
  We&#8217;ve been trying not to bum each other out, but it felt good to put
  that aside and have a good hearty vent session.</p>
<p>After work, I took Rod to the market.  Cooking is a great way to
  channel work stress, and last night my goal was to funnel all my
  emotions into making a big pot of soup.  Rod and I picked up two whole
  cabbages, some bacon, chicken stock, carrots, onions, Gruyère cheese,
  and a load of sourdough bread.  When we got home, I got to work
  blanching the cabbage while Rod peeled some carrots.  Everything went
  into the same pot - carrots, onions, bacon, and two whole heads of
  sliced cabbage, filled to the top with chicken stock.  It was good
  that the lid of my Dutch oven was so heavy, because everything in the
  pot needed to be weighed down and compressed to fit in the pot.  The
  soup simmered for an hour and a half.  I was tempted to open the lid
  about 30 minutes in, but some good smells started to fill the kitchen
  and that was enough proof for me that Stefan, yet again, was a good
  bet.</p>
<p>Marissa, Rod, and I ate the soup outside on the porch while the sun
  went down.  It was a little mild for a weeknight recipe, but I&#8217;m still
  going to keep this recipe in my back pocket for the next time one of
  us catches a cold or has a sensitive stomach.  The soft cabbage,
  tender bacon, and warm chicken broth was comforting, but the soup
  never got the after dinner nap it really deserved.</p>
<p>Since dinner was a little light, we took Rod to go get some ice cream.
  We jumped in the car and drove down the street to McDonalds.  When we
  got home, we let Rod watch an episode of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3952774/">Stinky &amp; Dirty</a> while he
  finished his ice cream, then Marissa put him to bed.</p>
<p>I had lots of chores to catch up, and since Kids Code starts this
  week, I wanted to make Thursday&#8217;s dinner ahead of time.  I fried up a
  pound of bacon and made garlic mayo for BLT sandwiches, then cleaned
  the kitchen.  Marissa sanded frames in the dining room, and we both
  listened to the new Taylor Swift album.  I wasn&#8217;t a fan of the album
  at first, and there are so many lyrics and little noises she makes
  that make me roll my eyes, but last night I&#8217;d have to conclude that
  the thing that saves the album is the production.  Every song - even
  the ones I can&#8217;t stand - sound so good as a finished product.</p>
<p>Chores wrapped up around 10:30.  Marissa and I caught up on some
  YouTube videos, then we started a movie.  Marissa proposed that we
  try to watch more movies, even if we have to spread them out over two
  days, and the challenge of watching every movie we own appealed to
  me.  Last night, I used my pick on the movie <i>Hitch</i>.  That movie has
  not aged well.  The classic scenes, like Will Smith teaching Kevin
  James to dance, still hold up, but the rest of the movie just sounds
  so bizarre to me now.  Ten years ago, it was a suave, sexy romantic
  comedy.  In high school, I thought the dialog was pretty smooth.
  Watching it again, the film is packed with so many cliches, it almost
  feels like I&#8217;m watching a surreal Tim &amp; Eric sketch or something.</p>
<p>In a bit, I&#8217;m heading into work to fight more fires, armed with
  leftover cabbage soup.  I have a feeling I&#8217;ll need the comfort food
  today.  After work, I&#8217;m making some BLTs for the family, then heading
  over to the library for our first Kids Code session of the semester.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful Thursday today.  Remember, /Life is not
  the amount of breaths you take, it&#8217;s the moments that take your breath
  away./ Quiz time - was that a Taylor Swift lyric or a line from
  <i>Hitch</i>?</p>
