<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re feeling good this morning.  Today
  it&#8217;s already drizzling a bit.  The street is glistening with rain from
  last night, but it&#8217;s somehow still so chilly it feels like it could
  snow at any second.  In other words, it&#8217;s prime hoodie weather.  This
  morning, I&#8217;m wearing my unofficial/official winter work outfit
  comprised of my favorite black hoodie and my favorite black
  sweatpants.  These pants are great because with a little bit of work,
  you can create an illusion with the rest of the outfit that they&#8217;re
  anything but sweatpants.  But I know the truth - that I just get away
  with wearing sweatpants all day.  So coziness is at an all time high.</p>
<p>It feels nice to begin another week of work.  We&#8217;re entering into what
  will probably be the longest stint of continuous, regular work hours
  for me this holiday season.  I have two weeks, and one of those weeks
  I&#8217;m on ticket duty.  Ticket duty always puts me in a working mood, so
  I&#8217;m hoping that spills over into my personal life and gives me some
  much needed vigor in catching up on Christmas shopping.  Who do I have
  to buy presents for?  That&#8217;s a good question.  My wife handles all the
  actual presents, so I&#8217;m mainly talking about the secret santas in my
  life.  But I take secret santa very seriously - whether it&#8217;s a
  complete stranger on the Internet or a friend from college.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty wonderful day.  In the morning, Marissa added
  my journal entry about the gallery, and I got a pretty remarkable and
  exciting spike in traffic, so that was fun.  I try to respect my
  wife&#8217;s online identity and give her space with it, but needless to
  say, I appreciate and will gladly accept the ol&#8217; Astuary Art bump any
  time she&#8217;s handing it out.</p>
<p>So all morning, taking breaks to glance at the analytics, I cooked
  breakfast and finished tidying up the house.  Around lunch time, I
  took Rodney to the grocery store.  Being away from our house for so
  long this weekend, are fridge was looking a little scarce, and that
  wouldn&#8217;t do for the upcoming week.  We picked up supplies to make
  dinner, along with some good ol&#8217; fashioned turkey sandwich
  ingredients.</p>
<p>After we got home, I got to making lunch.  Rodney considered helping
  me in the kitchen, but then retracted his offer, deciding he was too
  tired an needed some time to recharge on the couch.  I happily
  obliged - his apologetic and conscientious attitude was pretty cute.
  In his own words, he said &#8220;[gibberish] uh, Dada - Rodney uh watch
  Blippi I sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;NoooO prawwwblim,&#8221; I said, doing my best to translate the sentiment
  in his own words.</p>
<p>We ate turkey sandwiches and watched Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.
  I&#8217;m embarrassed to say that was yet another childhood classic I missed
  out on, and seeing it yesterday was my absolute first time watching
  the movie.  I had assumed it was all (<i>spoiler alert</i>) about how
  Rudolph bears the burden of a silly red glowing nose then finds out
  how useful it is when Santa has to navigate a snowstorm, but I also
  assumed that they don&#8217;t go into more detail than what&#8217;s provided in
  the song.  The side plots of him joining Reindeer school, finding a
  reindeer school sweet heart, getting bullied - not to mention the elf
  that wants to be a dentist.  That was all new and strange to me on the
  first watch.</p>
<p>Rodney went down for a nap, as did I.  I had a beer with lunch, not to
  mention a sandwich full of tryptophan.  So slithering into my side of
  the bed upstairs, it was no surprise that I passed out for two hours,
  taking one of those deep space, floating-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean
  naps.  Peak relaxation.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, I emerged and waddled downstairs to start
  dinner.  I got to slicing vegetables for our soup, and once I got the
  carrots, onions, leaks, pork, and just a whole heck done of sliced,
  blanched cabbage on the pot, I once again tidied the kitchen up.
  Soups are great because all the work happens at the beginning, then
  you basically have an extra hour to kill.  After cleaning up, I used
  the rest of the time to experiment with my broiler.  On cabbage and
  pork soup, I usually toast some sliced bread in the oven, with maybe a
  layer of gruyere and some cracked pepper.  And thinking that might
  come out looking even better if I got the cheese to bubble and crust a
  bit, I went on an oven adventure.  The broiler was easy to turn on -
  just a button that says &#8220;broil&#8221; right beside the one I usually press
  to bake things.  A small blue flame bled from the top of the oven.  I
  cautiously extended my hand below it - it felt hot, and perhaps even
  hot enough to bubble some cheese.  I slipped the slices of bread in
  the oven and wandered into the living room to check on Rodney.</p>
<p>Rodney&#8217;s sniffles were slowly developing into a cold (last night he
  actually got a bit of a fever), but he seemed content just zoning out
  in front of the TV.  I cuddled with him for a few minutes, then
  smelling burnt cheese, I sprung up and checked on my broiler
  experiment.</p>
<p>Burnt.  <i>Damn</i>.  But only slightly burnt.  Really, the piece of bread
  in the middle was the only one that didn&#8217;t make it out alive, but the
  others looked pretty appetizing.  So the take-away from this
  experiment was that I have a working broiler, and that could make
  things interesting in the future.</p>
<p>I finished seasoning the soup with salt, pepper, and cyan.  I decied
  that being a watery, bland soup, I could get away with a lot of cyan
  pepper.  The goal was to make the soup get your nose to run without
  tasting spicy, and it worked out pretty well.  Cyan pepper is an
  unsung hero of the kitchen.  I usually add a bit to everything
  ironically, like Chef John does, but in his live stream video he got
  to rambling about how he has a theory that a touch of cyan pepper can
  open up the taste buds on parts of your tongue that are normally
  close, and I think he&#8217;s on to something.  I think a bit of it in soup
  can activate just enough of the spicy food response to get the blood
  flowing around the mouth and nose and allow you to smell more.</p>
<p>After dinner, we put Rodney to bed.  Marissa had some painting to do,
  and I started a load of dishes and crashed on the couch with Ziggy.  I
  missed my dogs, and I&#8217;m so glad they&#8217;re home.  We watched some YouTube
  videos, then finally after about an hour I emerged to half-ass some
  evening chores.  I put the kitchen away, took the garbage out, then
  checked on Marissa.  She was wrapping up a time lapse, so I used the
  rest of the time to record some music for the video I&#8217;ll probably be
  editing today.  I used to use actual songs, but after taking the time
  to actually read Instagram&#8217;s terms of conditions that are pertinent to
  using music in videos, I&#8217;ve concluded that - in the parlance of our
  time - <i>they have no chill</i>.  Virtually, you can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t use
  any actual music in your videos.  Isn&#8217;t that sad?  Think about how
  much cooler Instagram would be if you could use music that people
  actually like, instead of that safe &amp; poppy royalty free crap that you
  have to play instead.  So in the interest of not trolling soundcloud
  for the afformentioned crap, we&#8217;re going the acoustic guitar noodling
  route.  It was fun recording music, and even in the half hour I spent
  fiddling with Audacity, I discovered several more features that I&#8217;m
  pretty excited about.  What I was anticipating being kind of a rough
  recording actually came out sounding decent - just as decent as
  anything I&#8217;ve made in Garageband.  And as we all know, every time you
  find a free software replacement for something made by Apple, an angel
  gets its wings.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I got today.  In three minutes, I&#8217;ll be on a bus, and my
  on-call shift will start, so set phasers to kill and phone volume to
  max.  Hope you all have a wonderful day today.</p>
