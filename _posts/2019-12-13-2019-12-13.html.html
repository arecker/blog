excerpt: sickness, breakfast, pair programming, and the usual suspects
---
<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re doing well today.  I&#8217;m feeling
  good this morning, and at this point - knock on wood - I feel like
  I&#8217;ve survived whatever cold has been going around.  Not only was
  Rodney afflicted, but a handful of my teammates at work too.  There
  were occasions this week where my mouth felt dry, and I felt for sure
  that I would wake up the next morning with that all too familiar
  throat tickle that is the ominous harbinger of a soar throat.  But now
  here we are Friday morning, still humming along.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m grateful that I didn&#8217;t get sick.  Did you know I&#8217;m a real baby
  about getting sick?  I&#8217;m not one of these people that can still get on
  with their day.  If I get a soar throat, I pretty much need to close
  up for the day and hide under a blanket for hours.  The other weird
  thing about me is that I never seem to get sick on work days.  If it
  happens, it&#8217;s almost always Friday afternoon, just as I&#8217;m heading into
  a weekend.  This was almost always the case with school, as if my
  immune system was fighting on reserve power, and once it was quitting
  time my antibodies punched out for the weekend and let the virus run
  amuck for a while.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the subject, I hope everyone out there - especially
  those who are sick - are feeling better, or at least taking the time
  they need to heal and rest up.  These winters are just brutal, aren&#8217;t
  they?</p>
<p>So this morning, I&#8217;m sitting at the computer with a belly full of
  coffee, and I&#8217;m taking a minute to reflect on why I never eat
  breakfast.  My sister brought it up in our family online chat where I
  post my daily journal entries.  &#8220;You always talk about dinner, but
  what are you eating for breakfast?&#8221; she asked.  The disappointing
  truth is that I&#8217;m a member of the shameful breakfast skippers club.
  On weekdays, I break out my work lunch at eleven.  I like eating early
  because it&#8217;s easy to find a spot to sit and the kitchen at work is
  much less busy.  But it&#8217;s also probably because I&#8217;m hungry.</p>
<p>This morning, I&#8217;ve packed a little Tupperware container of yesterday&#8217;s
  leek &amp; potato soup.  I tied it in a Ziploc bag, and I guess that&#8217;s a
  reflection of my trust in my Tupperware.  I also stuffed a little
  baggie of toasted, peppered croutons I made last night, with some
  shredded mexican cheese.  Inspecting the bag this morning, it appears
  some of the cheese melted around the croutons that were still warm,
  but I have a feeling that after I dump the whole mess into a bowl of
  soup at work, it won&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m a breakfast skipper, at least during the work week.  Don&#8217;t get
  me wrong - I&#8217;m not a breakfast hater.  On the weekends, we usually
  sleep in a bit and I really go nuts with the pancakes, Dutch babies,
  bacon, and sometimes potatoes.  Marissa and I sit around the dining
  room table drinking coffee and digesting food until it&#8217;s basically
  lunch time.</p>
<p>When it comes to lunch, I&#8217;m either eating dinner leftovers from last
  night, or eating somewhere special with my work team.  I almost never
  make anything for dinner that doesn&#8217;t leave enough leftovers for
  everybody&#8217;s lunch the next day, and it&#8217;s pretty easy to do.  In fact,
  it&#8217;s probably a lot harder to bake exactly enough food for a single
  dinner between two adults and one toddler.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my eating story.  This morning, maybe to shake things up,
  I&#8217;ll grab a granola bar out of our little stash by the coffee bar and
  eat it on the bus.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty great day.  I rolled into work, and despite a
  meeting heavy day, I still kept on track and finished a lot of work.
  After our last meeting of the day, I pair programmed with a teammate.
  In pair programming, usually one person does all the coding and
  testing - the &#8220;driver&#8221; - and the other person is kind of the
  &#8220;spotter&#8221;.  You help guide the problem solving, and you use your
  laptop to help google things, and maybe test one-off scenarios for
  them.</p>
<p>After work, I took the bus home, greeted Marissa, then slowly turned
  on the lights in Rodney&#8217;s room.  He was fast asleep, and though torn
  between waking up and going to Hy-Vee with me or abstaining from
  errands for more sleep, he summoned the willpower to climb out of bed
  and join us downstairs.</p>
<p>Rodney was quiet at Hy-Vee.  Normally he likes to walk beside the
  cart, and even trail behind me by about twenty feet (I think he enjoys
  the independence).  But he wasn&#8217;t feeling well, and just wanted to sit
  in the cart.  I could imagine that right now he has the kind of soar
  throat that feels like hell after breathing through his mouth for the
  duration of an afternoon nap.</p>
<p>At home, Rodney crashed on the couch and I got to making soup, which
  was a pretty easy task, since the night before while cleaning the
  fridge I decided to slice all the vegetables ahead of time.  This time
  around, I threw in a couple of carrots into the mix.  What surprised
  me is that those carrots managed to turn the whole soup to a shade of
  orange, which was unsettling at first, but later as we gathered around
  the table to eat soup sprinkled with cheese, the orange color deceived
  me into thinking there was more cheese than their actually was.  So
  that was interesting.</p>
<p>And the toasted croutons were a hit.  I simply cubed up a loaf of
  french bread and tossed the chunks with olive oil and some salt, then
  I went a little crazy on the pepper.  I baked them on a sheet pan for
  about fifteen minutes.  The crunchy, peppery croutons submerged in hot
  creamy soup mentally brought me back to a time where we used to eat at
  Champ&#8217;s as a family after Sunday church.  On cold days, I would get
  the soup, and it had all these croutons floating around, and when you
  went to eat them, a long strand of melted cheddar would stretch from
  your spoon to the surface.  So that&#8217;s the effect I was trying to
  achieve.</p>
<p>Marissa put Rodney to bed, and I finished up my Secret Santa present.
  This year, I&#8217;m participating in the reddit Chicago Bears secret santa
  exchange, which they call &#8220;Secret Ditka&#8221;.  I got my match a cooler
  back pack that was on his wishlist, and I threw in some squeaky cheese
  curds and a long rambling letter.</p>
<p>After chores, Marissa and I finished watching <i>The Usual Suspects</i>.
  We had been helping each other follow the action, and even though she
  had lots of questions in the last ten minutes of the movie, I was
  afraid to say anything.  The ending of <i>The Usual Suspects</i> is so
  good, I fear what punishment awaits in the afterlife for the crime of
  spoiling the ending for somebody on their first watch.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  Hope you stay warm and healthy today.
  Eat soup, watch movies, and only bother with breakfast if you have
  time for it.</p>
