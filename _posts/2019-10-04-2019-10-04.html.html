<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone! This morning I’m coming to you from my parents’
  house in Geneva Illinois. Outside there are clear skies, and there’s a
  cozy chill in the air that’s crept its way indoors. I’ve got my
  favorite zip up on, a hot cup of coffee, and it’s time to write.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning was a highly coordinated family packing scenario. I
  woke up about forty-five minutes ahead of everyone else - just enough
  time to drink coffee, shake the sleep off, and write a journal
  entry. I went upstairs and got Rodney out of his room. We made some
  scrambled eggs, and shortly after Marissa joined us at the table. We
  used the last few moments of breakfast to make a packing list, then
  the packing &amp; grooming frenzy began. Along with packing ourselves, we
  had to pack Rodney, the dogs, and a lunch to eat on the way. I jumped
  on the opportunity to evacuate all of our leftovers out of the fridge
  and into a cooler. There’s nothing worse than coming home to spoiled
  food in your fridge, right? It was a true victory lap of everything
  we’ve eaten that week. We had sliced honey crisp apples,
  saucijzenbroodjes, roasted red potatoes, a slice of deep dish pizza,
  and a fist full of paw patrol fruit snacks.</p>
<p>We all hit the road at 11:30 AM on the dot. Our first stop was
  Target. I needed a plain white dress shirt, and Marissa wanted to get
  Rodney some special train toys to make this weekend a little more
  special for Rodney.</p>
<p>We dropped the dogs off at the kennel around 1. Ollie, as usual, was
  pretty fine about it, but Zig Zig surprised us with a little last
  minute ambivalence. She tried to hide in Marissa’s lap, which really
  broke our heart. Zig Zig has always been so head strong and quick to
  throw herself into new experiences, and it was likewise heart-warming
  and heart-breaking to see her wear her mixed feelings on her
  sleeve. Last night as I was falling asleep, I thought about the dogs,
  and I wondered if Zig Zig was also lying awake thinking about us too.</p>
<p>We made it to my parents’ house at 3, giving us a nice comfortable
  hour to unpack, get dressed, and even sneak in a pre-rehearsal
  beer. Rodney shocked us all with… um… a pretty explosive surprise that
  was the result of drinking too much apple juice in the car. As Marissa
  and I were tended to him, I remarked that as far as diaper changes go,
  this was the quadruple bypass equivalent - and I stand by
  that. Marissa had the intensity of a trauma surgeon, and I may as well
  have been a nurse dabbing her forehead with one of those little
  operating room sponges.</p>
<p>After the biohazards were contained, we drove behind my parents to
  College church for the rehearsal, which was quite literally a drive
  down memory lane. Marissa and I had a lot of fun slowly remembering
  the landmarks around downtown Wheaton and campus. We had a good laugh
  pointing out all of our old make-out spots.</p>
<p>After getting to the church, Rodney saw Alice across the chapel and
  yelled her name. The two grabbed each other’s hands, and at last the
  partners in crime were reunited. During the rehearsal, Jeremy and I
  watched the younglings. Rodney shared his crayons, and Alice shared
  her graham crackers. Rodney was also particularly chatty during the
  rehearsal. Every five minutes or so, he would interrupt the pastor
  with an exuberant GOOD JOB MAMA, accompanied by Rodney’s trademark
  thumbs up, of course.</p>
<p>After the rehearsal, we made our way to the Oster house for
  dinner. The food was delicious - that was about all I remembered from
  the fog of trying to get Rodney to eat while also making sure he
  didn’t break anything. I trust you’ll keep this between just the two
  of us, reader - but we had a close call with a dinner napkin and a
  candle stick. But all is well that ends well.</p>
<p>This morning, I’m having my fill of coffee, and I might sneak a bite
  of this vanilla cake that’s sitting on the counter in front of me. In
  a few minutes, I’ll get Marissa and Rodney up. Marissa has bridesmaid
  things to do, but as far as Rodney and I are concerned, we’re going to
  go out to breakfast with grandpa.</p>
<p>It’s a great day to get married, isn’t it? Remember to pack extra
  diapers, watch the apple juice intake, and if all goes well, let’s
  have a wedding!</p>
