<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Yesterday was a day of driving.  Sometime around the third or fourth
  hour, all of us started showing cracks in our composure.  Our icecream
  had run out.  We hit weekend Dells traffic.  The car started to feel
  stuffy and sticky, and none of us felt like talking.  But we made it
  home, and it felt so good to come into the house, close the door, and
  take a hot shower.  Marissa climbed back into the car to go pick up
  the dogs, while Rodney and I stayed behind and tried to fit an entire
  weekend of R&amp;R into just a few hours, and it felt like we got pretty
  close.</p>
<p>We got home a little later than we thought we would, and even though
  the plan was to talk to the market to pick up some food, it felt cruel
  to take Rodney on a long walk outside.  He was settled in on the couch
  watching spider-man.  So instead of running errands, we just ordered a
  pizza.  I joined him on the couch and flipped through some comic books
  I loaned him from my shelf.  He&#8217;s way off from being able to
  understand them, but he likes looking at the pictures and trying to
  find cool Spider-Man poses.</p>
<p>Marissa got home with the dogs around 8:45.  &#8220;The drive was fine -
  there was traffic, but I only screamed twice and cried once,&#8221; she
  laughed.  After letting Rodney play with the dogs for a few minutes, I
  put him to bed.  Marissa and I ate some sliced up gouda on the couch
  and caught up on YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Aside from a stiff neck from tubing and a touch of sunburn on my legs,
  I&#8217;m feeling pretty good this morning.  I&#8217;m ready to attack a new week.
  And this week is going to be a doozy.  We&#8217;re pressing on with our
  intern project at work, and this week will likely be fraught with
  blockers and last minute fixes.  I&#8217;m also hoping to get started on my
  next computer build.  I&#8217;m going to take apart the downstairs computer
  and mount the parts to Plexiglas in my room, so this week I hope to at
  least open it up to see what we&#8217;re dealing with.  I&#8217;ve also been
  chipping away at a side project that&#8217;s still in pretty good shape.
  I&#8217;m glad I had the foresight to catch up on emails last Thursday
  before we left for Hayward.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, did you know that I still get emails?  That might
  be the best part of this blog.  I used to provide a section under each
  article for comments, but I&#8217;ve accidentally found that when you omit
  the comments, people reach out to you in other ways, and it&#8217;s a lot
  more personal and substantive.  Some weeks, I&#8217;ll have a real, personal
  email thread ongoing between four or five people.  It gives me a lot
  of joy.  And if you&#8217;re out there and you&#8217;ve been reading these
  updates, drop me a line and say hello!  I&#8217;m still at
  <a href="mailto:alex@reckerfamily.com">alex@reckerfamily.com</a>.</p>
<p>Time to get going.  I really need to shave - at some point over the
  weekend my rugged beard became a negligent beard.  Let&#8217;s have a
  Monday.  And just in case you&#8217;re not all the way rested up from this
  weekend, take an hour today to just sit and eat some gouda.</p>
