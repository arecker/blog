excerpt: christmas lights, cheap seats, and the sunday scaries

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re having a good Sunday.  This
  morning, time seems to be getting away from me.  The plan was to wake
  up early and enjoy some coffee before church, but all of the sudden it
  was 9:30, and Rodney was awake.  Before I knew it, the 11 AM service
  was bearing down on us, and it became sort of a rushed situation.</p>
<p>At least Rodney is having a pretty low key morning.  He was pretty
  upset that I made him put on a button down shirt, but we find that he
  usually comes around to any outfit as long as he has time to wind down
  and sit by himself.  This morning, he&#8217;s sitting on the living room
  couch watching Bill &amp; Ted with a bowl of Cheerios.  Last I checked
  him, he was in good spirits.</p>
<p>Even if we sometimes have trouble getting out the door for church,
  Sundays are great.  After church, we&#8217;re going to go out as a family
  for pizza at Ian&#8217;s, then we&#8217;re hanging out around the house, finishing
  up projects while we watch the end of the Saints &amp; Vikings game.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty great day.  After a long, hearty breakfast, I
  spent the rest of the morning outside with Rodney collecting the
  Christmas lights.  As I teased the Christmas lights off our porch
  awning, bushes, and front yard tree, I did my best to keep things
  organized, but you can only do so much with Christmas lights.
  Especially the dangling &#8220;icicle&#8221; style lights.  Those things are going
  to look like hell, no matter how you wrap them.  Yesterday, I tried to
  at least bunch them up in their own large ziploc bag.  But it felt
  good to get the lights done.  And having everything packed up by
  January 4th is pretty respectable as a timetable I think.</p>
<p>After packing away the lights, I spent some time playing hockey with
  Rodney in the driveway.  Rodney&#8217;s getting pretty good with a hockey
  stick.  He officially shoots lefty.  At some point he even figured out
  how to hold his stick correctly, and his shot it looking pretty decent
  these days.</p>
<p>We went inside to escape the cold and eat some lunch.  Marissa was
  working on the living room windows, and she too took a break to eat
  some leftover pizza with us.  I straightened up the kitchen while
  Rodney finished up, then we all took a nap.  Marissa and I drifted off
  to sleep on the couch, letting <i>Cheap Seats</i> play on shuffle.</p>
<p>I rediscovered the show <i>Cheap Seats</i> last night.  While we were
  eating lunch, a picture of me, Marissa, and the Sklar Brothers
  appeared on our desktop computer slide show.  Over lunch, we reflected
  on how fun of a comedy show that was.  &#8220;Those guys are pros,&#8221; I said
  while chewing.  &#8220;And I can&#8217;t believe they spent like five minutes
  talking to us in the middle of state street.  They were super cool.&#8221;
  &#8220;And they talked to us after the show too, and remembered us,&#8221; Marissa
  added.</p>
<p>Reflecting on that comedy show put me in a Sklar mood.  <i>Cheap Seats</i>
  was a TV show they used to do on ESPN classic, where they would watch
  old sporting events and add their own snarky commentary, <i>Mystery
  Science Theater</i> style.  I still have every episode of the show saved
  on my Plex server, and it&#8217;s great to nap to.</p>
<p>The house started to slowly wake up in the early evening.  I got
  Rodney up, we put the dogs away, and we all jumped in the car to go
  bowling.  Rodney brought his stuffed giraffe, and insisted I carry him
  zipped up in my coat.  We bowled one game, taking a long break for
  pizza, then several more breaks to deal with our broken bowling lane.
  The first time Marissa walked up to the counter to tell them our lane
  was stuck, the guy gave her some attitude.  But after the fifth time,
  he was much more apologetic, and by the end of the game he had hooked
  us up with some free bowling coupons.</p>
<p>In last night&#8217;s game, I bowled a 109.  Rodney bowled something in the
  low nineties, and Marissa held down last place with something in the
  mid forties.  Keep in mind that Rodney is using the bumpers and the
  metal bowling ball ramp.</p>
<p>After putting Rodney to bed, I spent most of the night under the
  blanket on the couch.  My back has still been a little iffy all
  weekend, and I was convinced that I needed just one more solid period
  of inactivity, so I grabbed Ziggy and crashed on the couch.  We kept
  the Cheap Seats marathon rolling, watching more episodes on shuffle
  into the night while Marissa kept painting the windows.</p>
<p>I was grateful I got to take it easy most of the day yesterday.  For
  me, next work week is one of those weeks that makes me scared to look
  at my calendar.  Last time I checked, I had four code screens and a
  meeting on top of what my usual week looks like.  The Sunday scaries
  are mounting.  But before we get carried away thinking about how
  stressful the work week is going to be, there&#8217;s still plenty of Sunday
  left.  We haven&#8217;t even left for church yet.  We have pizza, football,
  and home projects as a distraction, not to mention more coffee to
  drink.  There&#8217;s plenty of things to do before I even start thinking
  about Monday.</p>
<p>The coffee is starting to kick in, and now I&#8217;m feeling pretty good.
  In a few minutes, I&#8217;ll jump in the shower, and I might even have time
  to brew an extra batch of tequila infused coffee to drink in church.
  That stuff is really starting to grow on me.  I&#8217;ll have to check out
  that place&#8217;s website later to see what else they got.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  Hope you all have a wonderful, relaxing
  Sunday.  If you have a scary work week coming up, I&#8217;d recommend taking
  some generous couch time and watching old episodes Cheap Seats.</p>
