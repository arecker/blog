excerpt: art, rest, and my mother the engineer

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  I&#8217;m back to our regularly scheduled program,
  up at 6:30, journaling by 7:30, and out the door by 8:00 sharp.  And
  even though I&#8217;m beginning what might be my shortest work week of the
  year, I&#8217;m still having a hard time waking up this morning.  We&#8217;ll see
  how that pans out.  At least I have the first hour of work to keep
  waking up.  Being out for a week, it takes about an hour to catch up
  on missed emails and slack messages, and while that&#8217;s important work,
  I can definitely get it done with half the brain capacity and use the
  time to drink more coffee.</p>
<p>This morning also feels a little weird because Rodney is staying with
  grandma and grandpa.  And since Marissa is a heavy sleeper, today I
  did a lot less tip-toeing than I normally due.  And I didn&#8217;t have to
  clamber over the baby gate at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty great day.  We got out the door and set up at
  the gallery just in time for people to start trickling in.  After a
  couple of hours, I took Rodney home to make some lunch, and when we
  returned I surprised her with an oven warmed casserole dish filled
  with some leftover turkey sandwiches, warm stuffing, and mashed yams.</p>
<p>As a side-note, do you remember when Jon Stewart use to end each
  episode of the Daily Show with a &#8220;moment of zen&#8221;, which was just a
  bizarre 10 second snippet taken from an offbeat political interview or
  a weird interaction on cable news?  That concept has been making me
  laugh lately, and if I had a moment of Zen yesterday, it was when I
  was home alone with Rodney.  I had a pot of sweet potatoes boiling, I
  was trying to start a load of dishes, the washing machine went off in
  the basement, and Rodney called me over to the dining room table to
  give him a high five.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the gallery, my mom and dad showed up and hung
  around with Rodney while Marissa and I packed the car.  We made our
  way home, and they sat at the dinner table and briefed for the week
  with Rodney while I packed his clothes upstairs.  I joined them
  afterwards, and even talked them into snacking on a leftover pancake.
  As we gave them the Rodney rundown, I couldn&#8217;t help but marvel as an
  observer at how complicated Rodney is these days.  Before we could
  talk, it was just a matter of occasional food, a daily nap, and
  frequent diaper changes.  But now he&#8217;s got all these weird rituals,
  intertwined with his own way of speaking and seeing the world.  Last
  night, over slack my Mom told us that he threw a bit of a pity party
  before bed because she didn&#8217;t know what he meant by <i>piggies?</i> &#8220;That&#8217;s
  when you tuck each of his toes into the blanket before bed,&#8221; Marissa
  explained.  &#8220;How do you even do that?&#8221;  As we sat on the couch, I
  laughed and joined in, &#8220;tell her that you more or less just pretend
  to - it&#8217;s more just a variation of your typical before bed tickling.&#8221;</p>
<p>As my parents were preparing to leave with Rodney, my mom poked around
  in my kitchen.  She compliment how clean my fridge was.  And that was
  high praise, because my mom keeps a very clean fridge, and having just
  returned from Minnesota over Thanksgiving and rolling right into an
  art gallery, the house was still kind of in disarray.</p>
<p>I think in another life, my mother would have made a good engineer.
  She&#8217;s a natural optimizer, and one of the best examples of it was
  yesterday, when even as she had an immediate grasp of how I organize
  my fridge and was complimenting it, she was still compulsively fixing
  the orientation of the labels - which I found in no way off-putting.
  I usually turn the labels forward myself.</p>
<p>I meet lots of people, like my mother, who don&#8217;t think of themselves
  as computer people but would have made great programmers.  Marissa
  would tell you that I&#8217;ve rambled about how organizing data on a
  computer is, in spirit, exactly the same as organizing food in your
  fridge.  Get rid of the garbage, minimize duplication, and sacrifice
  easily accessible spots for things you frequently access.  Because
  you&#8217;ll only reach for the Korean gochu paste about once a month, it
  can afford to be on the bottom shelf behind the specialty mustard.
  Something you use every day should be the first thing you see when you
  open the door - like the milk or butter.</p>
<p>We waved goodbye to Rodney on the front porch, then Marissa took a
  well-deserved nap on the couch while I unpacked the car.  She admitted
  to me during the gallery that she pulled a late-nighter to finish the
  inventory she&#8217;s be displaying at Goodman.  But you&#8217;d never know it
  talking to her - I got a cool six hours of sleep, and she was more
  chipper than me all day.</p>
<p>Around 6:30, we put the dogs away then jumped in the car to find
  somewhere to eat.  As a parent, it&#8217;s always weird seeing how quickly
  you can go places without having a kid to worry about.  After putting
  our shoes and coats on, we stood there for about a second at the door,
  like we were both surprised there was nothing left to gather up.</p>
<p>The biting winter air put us in the mood for ramen, but after making
  the perilous &amp; windy trip downtown, we discovered that Morris ramen
  was closed for Sunday evening.  After some grumbling, we drove to
  Umami instead.  We had a nice dinner, chatting and watching snapchats
  from my mom and dad.  Rodney was eating dinner and playing with a snap
  bracelet.</p>
<p>When we returned from dinner, Marissa and I collapsed on the couch and
  watched sketch comedy reruns.  We only got up a handful of times to
  get a snack, pour a drink, or play with the dogs, who were wildly
  running of their day cooped up in the house.  Remember I talked about
  using the time without Rodney to catch up on chores and do special
  projects?  I&#8217;m already starting to think the time would be better
  spent not doing a damn thing at all.  It felt good to unplug and
  relax, and even though I&#8217;m coming off of a week vacation, we&#8217;ve spent
  very little time acting like we&#8217;re on vacation.</p>
<p>So today, back to the office for a short work week.  I work until
  Wednesday, then I have off for a Bears game and another art gallery.
  After work, Marissa and I are going to go to the grocery store and
  pick up dinner.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Happy December!  If you have
  a full five day week this week, take heart.  I bet you&#8217;ve got some
  time-off coming, and it&#8217;s right around the corner.</p>
