In my final college semester I took a class called Synthetic
Chemistry.  There were no lectures or exams.  The whole class was just
a set of lab experiments you'd perform at your own leisure with a
partner.

I was lucky enough to be partnered with Johnny.  Johnny and I were a
good team.  We both liked to move fast and crack jokes to keep things
interesting.  Some of the more diligent students took the time to
complete lab write-ups as they want, but Johnny and I saved all of
them for the last week of the semester.  Johnny was usually looking
over my shoulder while I wrote these.  To get a laugh, I'd single him
out in my notes by commenting on his outfit choices or ragging on his
taste in indy music, knowing we'd both be pouring over these notes to
finish our reports.

LinkedIn tells me Johnny went on to earn his PhD and he's currently
working as a real research scientist at Tate & Lyle.  Johnny - sorry,
_Dr. Johnny_ - I had so much fun that semester.  Thanks for the fun
memories.

## January 29-30, 2013

Today I am working with Johnny on the cheese lab.

10.0168 g of powdered milk was wighed into a flask.

Added to water, heating it to 45 degrees before we add some
glacial acetic acid.  No diggity.

About 3.5 g of Cellite was mixed with 15 ml of 90% EtOH and filtered
onto a buchner funnell.

Johnny set the cheesy cloth aside and added 1.5 K2CO3 to the water
while stirring.  Some bubbling.  Meanwhile, I made the cellite filter
and set it aside.

We put the cheese water into in an EM flask and added a bunch of
boiling stones, then heating it over an open flame.  A lot of bumping
and foam in there, I certainly hoping those chemicals are saving
themselves for marriage.

Letting it cool down.  Orange, with some yellowish to it (not even),
that's why I think the proteins are out.  Filtered it once it was cool
enough to touch.  Slow.  Definitely collecting some more

We stopped filtering when we were getting a lot of
bubbles. Transferred it to a beaker with plenty of stones, man.
Heating that up now over an open flame.  Scared it's going to boil
over... that would be embarrassing.

Looks ok.  Not too much foaming.  Wooh.

Johnny looks really good today.  Goattee as always, red shirt, nice
butt.  I really wish I had more jeans in that color.  Man alive.
Johnny looks good.

The solution boiled down to about 10-15 mL.  We took it off the flame
and moved it to a hot plate, adding 50 mL of hot 95% EtOH and 0.4 g of
decolorizing carbon.  The mixture turned orange and brown.  Letting it
warm on a hot plate.

Meanwhile, I've made another Celite pad filter with 15 mL of EtOH and
3 g of cellite.  Let it dry in a funnel.  Getting ready to filter the
final solution.  Hoping that it will crystallize sooner than two days
so we can have something to do tomorrow.

Cleaned up.  Worried about the brown color.  I am not expecting
crystals.

Alrighty.  New rainy day.  I could use a nap.

Sadly the material didn't crystallize.  Not only that, but the brown
color is giving us the idea that it would be best to start over.

Tried again with more milk.  10.0098 g was used.  Filterered out the
Casein in a rag and added boiling stones to the filtrate.  Heating it
over an open flame.  This time we used a beaker.  Johnny is thinking
we may have burnt the last one, giving it a brown color.  I think he
may be on to something.

Also, he is wearing plaid today with nicely cut jeans and boots.
Excellent.

Occasional popping.  White powder gathering at bottom.  I don't think
that's the carbonate - that would be very soluble.

Cooling it down now.  It is much different than yesterday.  My notes
say that it was orange with yellow.  This solution is clear yellow with
white powder (presuming the proteins).

We poured the frothy filtrate into a big beaker with more boiling
stones.  Rinsed the filt flask with water and got a bit more.  Heating
off the water now.

New theory about the last one.  I think there was too much acid.  The
products hydrolyzed as they were heated, yielding a final brown
mixture that could only crystallize in the bizarro world.

Turned murky white when added ethanol.  Nothing changed when carbon
was added.  Filtering it.  COllecting a yellow white powder in the
funnel, relinquishing a piss water kind of stuff.  It's clear.  I'm
pumped as all hell for this solution.  This is going to crystallize
like a sonofabitch.

Hi there.  Johnny and I are ready to begin seperating my stuff.  My
crude diacetylferrocene was dissolved in methylene chloride while
the manual calls for it in ethyl acetate.  I am now evaportating off
the meth chloride. It says to use half, but I don't have a lot to
begin with.  I will probably just same some crude for TLC,
and dissolve all of it in ehtyl acetate.

I did so.  I saved a drop or two for TLC, then dissolved the rest
in EtOAc.  Johnny set up a really stellar column for the seperation
We have six large test tubes ready to collect fractions.  We are
expecting resolved colored bands, so not really fretting about
checking UV in the meantime.

Wow.  Johnny is really good at this.  We are getting beautiful
separation on my cruddy diacetyl ferrocene.

The first band was yellow.  Next band is orange.  Above that is red
that is lead a bit by yellow.

</a>
</figure>

We got the second (orange) band out with a couple fractions.  The top
two seemed to have separated more - red and yellow.  We speculated
that this is 1,1' diacetyl and 1,3-diacetyl.  That would be interesting
insight...

After the orange band was collected, we switched from the original 20%
EtOAc / Hexanes to 50:50.  The red and yellow were well separated now.

</figure>

All the fractions were collected.  We think the red is our diacetyl
ferrocene.  We are taking a TLC of the standard ferrocenes mix,
Johnny's recrystallized acetylferrocene, the standard ferrocene,
and the red band.  Hopefully this will make it clear that the red band
is indeed diacetylferrocene.  There is probably not much of it, in any
means.  Eluting in 20% EtOAc.

I made a TLC plate with the standard mix, standard Ferrocene, J's
acetylferrocene, and the red band.  It matched up pretty perfectly
with the first band on the standard mixture.  We evaporated it on a
rotary (forgot to tare it) and got a chalky red powder.  Looks good.
Feels good.

We will take a melting point and UV-vis next week when we start the
Cholesterol lab.

We are first boiling an egg.  I don't know... I guess I am just
hungry, OK?

JK.  It's part of the experiment!  Johnny looks like he could
fertilize some pretty healthy eggs on his own.  Wink wink.

My yolk was 14.28 g.  What a beauty.  Johnny's was 14.13 g.

We combined methanol and ether (as in the manual) and mixed it for
about seven minutes.  Decanted it into a huge rbf flask (250 mL).
Some schmutz, but no worries.  Kind of took a while to decant.

Not too much recorded here.  We are going to start the reflux
tomorrow.  Looks good.  Egg gunk sitting in my drawer.  We finally got
it dry.

We refluxed the yellow mess in KOH / EtOH 15% wt/vol (25 mL) for
25 minutes.  Dissolved easily.

Crude cholesterol weight: 0.8514 g.
Crystallization in hot methanol with decolorizing carbon.

Final weight of the recrystallized cholesterol was 17.9936-17.9810

Jolly good.

## March 19-20, 2013

Hey there, sailor.

Back from spring break.  Dr. Niem. told us to start on the synthesis
of binapthol.  Starting that today.

I went a head and added 300 mL of water to a 1 L EM flask.  Johnny
weighed 7.2 g of 2 napthol.  We combined them in the flask and started
heating it.

The napthol was pale - washed purple colored and leaf like.  Brittly.
I have a feeling it could be a while before it dissolves.

While waiting for it to dissolve, Johnny weighed out 17 g of FeCl3.
It was a big old brick.  Looked like candy.

So I guess the napthol is not supposed to dissolve.  Looking for oil.

Woah - there it goes.  The oil formed... sort of the napthol melting.
Then the whole mixture turned pink.

We added some of the iron chloride.  Turned green and white.  Seethes.
Adding the rest over five minutes. Precipiate formed after half of it
was added.  Green stuff.  What an incredible cauldron!

</figure>

After heating it for ten minutes, we filtered out the crude green
material.  Looks like weed?

</figure>

Isolated:
Tare: 76.277 g
Crude: 87.59 - tare

So we heated the crude in about 70 mL of toluene.  There was a lot of
crude material that didn't dissolve at boiling, so we decanted it off
into a beaker and kept the material on the side.  Dark solution.  Let
cool to room and then iced.

Well hello.  When I got there, Johnny was already mixing the acetamide
(sp) There was 8.96 g.

We had to make a 7.0 M solution of Bromine in acetic acid, so we
measured 3.2 mL and diluted it to 9 mL with acetic acid.  We slowly
dripped it in over six minutes.  The solution changed from brown to
bright orange with ppt before I was done.

More stirring for 10 minutes.

Then poured it into cold water and filtered out the crude white
material.  It was white, so we did not need any NaHSO3 to consume any
bromine.  It was all gone.  I saved some crude material for TLC
analysis.  It looked like about 11 g or so.  Recrystallized it in two
portions with ~50 mL ethanol in both.

Beautiful crystals.  Not perfectly colorless, but still nice.  Set out
to dry.  We still have to take a melting point, TLC, and NMR.

Long hairlike crystals. Beautiful... wow.  Had problems with the
second port.  because the crystals were so fine.  Just letting the
funnel dry in my drawer now.  It looks like we have more work to do.

I hope we have enough product.
