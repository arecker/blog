<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  We woke up this morning to pretty steady rain
  outside.  The dogs were pretty thrown off.  At first they didn&#8217;t want
  to go outside, but I herded them into the lawn like a couple of sheep.
  Zig zig did her business under the porch, like a squirrel on the run.
  She would leave the other half of her business on the carpet just five
  minutes later.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Marissa took Ziggy to an agility trial in Milwaukee, so I
  had a whole day with Rodney.  We had some breakfast, then spent about
  an hour furthering the potty training effort while I cleaned up the
  kitchen.  Things are starting to look promising on that front - we
  would later have three successful potty sessions in total.  Rod and I
  walked to the community center to play some basketball.  Even though
  the regulation height hoops were way too tall for him, he seemed to
  have a good time just hanging out on the court and rolling the ball
  around.  I enjoyed myself quite a bit too.  It&#8217;s been a while since I
  took a few minutes to shoot hoops.  My long &amp; mid range game are
  pretty terrible, but I still have a pretty consistent lay up.</p>
<p>As I played basketball with Rodney, I thought about how I used to play
  with my friends in grade school during lunch.  I was a terrible
  shooter, so I tried to make a name for myself on the school court just
  stuffing people&#8217;s shots.  My friends used to tease me that I could
  only dribble in one direction, and my jump shot had a ridiculously
  high arc that would go well above the backboard some times.  The
  teasing was well-placed - like I said, I spent most of my time trying
  to figure out how to swat other people&#8217;s shots away, and half the time
  I&#8217;d end up just swatting their arm or head, and since there were no
  fouls in recess pick-up basketball, people just had to deal with me.
  I imagine I was pretty frustrating to play with.</p>
<p>At one point I joined the basketball team for school.  It was sixth
  grade, and I was still looking for a sport to plug into after track &amp;
  field didn&#8217;t really pan out.  I was on the team for about three weeks,
  and to my surprise the coach made us spend half of each practice just
  running laps around the gym.  I ran more during my three weeks of
  basketball practice then I ever did in my full school year of track.
  I remember in practice our coach was teaching us about how to shoot
  the ball.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a formula, like in math,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;You may happen
  to get it right some times, but if you&#8217;re guessing, then there&#8217;s no
  point.  You have to be able to shoot the same way every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess I never learned the formula.  I feel like I missed every shot
  I took at the community center, but Rodney didn&#8217;t really care.  He
  just wanted me to pick him up and hold him close to the hoop.  You
  have to wonder if that&#8217;s a legal basketball move.</p>
<p>When we were done shooting hoops, Rodney and I walked over to glass
  nickel for some lunch.  I felt like a beer, and Rodney and I were
  sweaty from playing basketball in the muggy weather.  We sat down in
  our usual table in the back, and Rodney quietly colored.  Taking a
  toddler out to lunch is a funny experience.  Rodney just
  unapologetically does his own thing, and you can try to interject with
  some simple questions and small talk, but before long you&#8217;re just
  having lunch by yourself.  &#8220;Oh, taking him out to lunch sucks,&#8221;
  Marissa joked later that night.  &#8220;I try to talk to him, but he just
  does his own thing and before you know it you&#8217;re just on your phone.&#8221;
  And I did bide the time with my phone.  While Rodney colored, I caught
  up on the Chicago Bears gossip in preparation for Monday&#8217;s game.  At
  least when the pizza arrived we had something to talk about.  &#8220;Tasty
  pizza!&#8221; said Rodney, twirling a long strand of mozzarella at the end
  of his fork.</p>
<p>After lunch, we picked up some groceries from the market.  Rodney was
  pretty upset that I didn&#8217;t let him pick out a small pumpkin.  Jenny
  Street market has them lined up all around the store, and the last two
  times I let Rod grab a pumpkin to put decoratively in our living room.
  And apparently, two times is enough to throw a small fit when it
  doesn&#8217;t happen.  But he got over it, probably because he was tired.</p>
<p>When we got home, Rodney took a long nap and I got dinner going.  I
  was making beef braised in red wine again, and that recipe is always a
  great excuse to drink Red wine in the middle of the day.  I poured a
  glass and caught up on YouTube videos.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening was nice.  Marissa got home before dinner, we
  ate, put Rodney to bed, then I edited together a time lapse for
  Marissa&#8217;s instagram while she worked in the resin lab.  I sat in the
  resin tent with her, which was nice and toasty since she set up a
  small space heater to help the paintings cure.</p>
<p>We ended the night with a movie.  Marissa&#8217;s pick was <i>Dan in Real
  Life</i>, which was a real breathe of fresh air after sitting through
  <i>Hitch</i> for three days.  I was beginning to wonder if <i>every</i> movie
  made ten years ago sucked, and I was too young to realize it.  Not the
  case.  The simpler explanation is usually the better explanation, and
  the simplest explanation is that <i>Hitch</i> sucks.</p>
<p>In a few moments, I&#8217;ll shower, then we&#8217;ll get ready for church.  We
  have some errands to run, but other than that I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;m
  going to do all day.  I&#8217;m equally interested in focusing on something
  productive, or just putzing around all day in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Hope you have a wonderful day today, and thanks for reading.</p>
