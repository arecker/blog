<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>One of my favorite things to make is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeling">kibbeling</a>, and I think I
  perfected it last night.  We all went to Hy-Vee after work to pick up
  a few different types of fish.  I bought about twenty bucks worth of
  fish, first going for the off-cuts of cod and halibut, then padding
  the rest with just shrimp.  I think the people working behind the meat
  counter appreciate getting rid of their off-cuts and leftovers -
  they&#8217;re always sitting right on top and it must be nice to not have to
  cut and weight it.</p>
<p>When we got home, I added two cups of milk, a half cup of Lemon La
  Croix (I think that&#8217;s the secret weapon), a pinch of salt and pepper,
  and two eggs to a bowl and mixed with a whisk.  I then added the
  flour.  I forgot to measure how much flour went in.  But it didn&#8217;t
  feel too necessary, since you can just add it in small portions,
  incorporate it, then decide for yourself if the batter is thick
  enough.  Personally, I like it thin and runny, even thinner than
  pancake batter.  I set aside the batter to rest in the fridge.</p>
<p>I rinsed and dried the fish, then cut it into small chunks (since they
  tend to fry better).  Marissa peeled the shrimp.  I added all the fish
  chunks and shrimp to a bowl and tossed it with a bit of salt and
  pepper.  I filled a dutch oven with about an inch and a half of peanut
  oil and turned the burner on.  While I was waiting for the heat to get
  to 320-330F, I made the dipping sauce - which is so easy and
  delicious.  It&#8217;s just a bowl of mayo, the juice of one lemon, a bunch
  of chopped dill, and two grated cloves of garlic.  Seriously, we
  didn&#8217;t need to even add any seasoning.  I might just start throwing
  this sauce on everything.</p>
<p>When the oil was hot enough, I started doing the fish chunks in
  batches - dunking them in the batter and letting the excess fall off,
  then slowly lowering them into oil.  I panicked as the fish pieces
  started sticking to the bottom of the pan, but then I remembered
  that&#8217;s fine at first, and that when they&#8217;re done cooking they pretty
  much float up to the top on their own.  The other nice thing about
  frying fish in small pieces is you can use a pair of chopsticks to
  flip and maneuver them around the hot oil.  After about two minutes, I
  nudged each piece with the side of a chopstick, and if it floated to
  the surface and gave off a flurry of tiny bubbles, I removed it from
  the oil and moved it to a paper towel.</p>
<p>Another thing to look out for is keeping the oil hot enough.  After
  each wave of fish, the temperature will drop - which is fine, you just
  have to wait a few seconds between batches to let it rise again.  I
  looked into it later, and it turns out that&#8217;s a basic technique of
  frying food, but I&#8217;m kind of new to this and had to rediscover it for
  myself.</p>
<p>After the last batch of fish went in, I rinsed a bowl of brussel
  sprouts and added them to boiling water, which was seasoned with sea
  salt and lemon juice.  That&#8217;s a play I took from French Cooking
  Academy&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM506j3tgY4">blanched asparagus recipe</a>, except it works even better on
  brussel sprouts because you can pop them in your mouth as a taste test
  while they boil.</p>
<p>Rodney, Marissa, and I sat around the table and munched on fish.
  Rodney was laughing really hard at the dogs while they were circling
  the table, and it felt good to laugh with him.  After dinner we went
  for a walk to check out the new construction machines parked on our
  street to repave Oak street.  It was a good day.</p>
