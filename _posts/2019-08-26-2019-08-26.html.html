<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.  What a beautiful morning.  Not conventionally
  nice morning - it&#8217;s chilly, the sun isn&#8217;t out yet, and it looks like
  it&#8217;s going to rain pretty much all day.  But after a long, humid,
  buggy summer, the change is welcomed.  I&#8217;ve been dying to wear a
  hoodie to work again, and today I may get my wish.</p>
<p>I had a wonderful weekend.  We got plenty of outdoor time, cooked some
  good recipes, and had plenty of moments to recharge.  Yesterday&#8217;s
  gnocchi turned out really good, and it was pretty easy to make.  I
  used two spoons to form the gnocchi, using that technique where you
  pass a little wad of dough back and forth until it forms a pillow,
  then you just gently shimmy it into hot water.  The first few came out
  a little rough, but I got the hang of it.  Once all the gnocchi were
  made, I browned them in butter on cast iron.  The brown looked pretty
  cool against the green (there was lots of basil ground into the dough,
  I promise it was supposed to come out green).  Not only did I redeem
  my first gnocchi attempt, but now I have a recipe that uses a whole
  container of ricotta cheese.  And I also know how to find the ricotta
  at my grocery store.  For some reason, it disappeared from the usual
  cheese wall, making me question if it was &#8220;out of season&#8221; or if
  ricotta was actually hard to come by during certain times of the year,
  but they just moved it over by the cream.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty tired today.  I must not have slept very well, I&#8217;m having a
  hard time getting any thoughts going this morning, which is why I&#8217;m
  finding it easier to just focus on what&#8217;s currently in my stomach
  instead.  Today will be the first regular work day I&#8217;ve had in a
  while.  Instead of running stand-up for the interns and handing out
  work, I&#8217;m going back to just being a regular guy on my team.  I&#8217;m
  looking forward to laying low today.  I&#8217;m going to knock out some
  individual work, and maybe even listen to a podcast or something.
  Then I&#8217;ll sneak out somewhere for a quick bite.</p>
<p>This week, I think I can&#8217;t avoid planning for the reunion.  I had the
  week wrong in my head, which earned me a whole extra week of putting
  it off, but now it&#8217;s <i>actually</i> two weeks away and it&#8217;s time to get
  the ball rolling.</p>
<p>For dinner tonight, I&#8217;m planning on making some Philly cheese steak
  sandwiches.  I watched a video last night - it just involves searing a
  cheap steak in olive oil, then cooking it on a bed of onions.  It all
  gets cut up and mixed with some cream cheese and peppers, then baked
  on a sandwich bun.  Since our dog Ziggy was born near Philly, we joked
  that she&#8217;s been <i>dying</i> to have a cheese steak again since moving to
  the land of cheese heads, so this is partly inspired by her hometown.</p>
<p>I think the coffee is finally kicking in.  I feel quickened with life,
  and suddenly I&#8217;m feeling motivated enough to shave this morning.  I&#8217;ve
  crossed that definite threshold that separates &#8220;indifferent, the style
  choice&#8221; from &#8220;indifferent&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  This morning before heading
  out, grab your favorite hoodie.  It might still be a little too warm
  for it, but you can always take it off later.  This morning, we can
  together live in the delusion that fall is here.</p>
