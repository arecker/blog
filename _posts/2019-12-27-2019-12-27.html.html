excerpt: gold rush, takeout, gifts, holiday spirit and clickbait

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  This morning, I&#8217;m coming to you from
  Rochester Minnesota, which is thankfully the last stop on our Holiday
  week jaunt across the Midwest.  It&#8217;s been a long week, and I&#8217;ve
  already started to fantasize about being back home and returning to
  regular weekday, weekends, and mornings.  But at least we&#8217;re keeping
  things simple this visit.  The day before we arrived, Renee &amp; Tom had
  just finished hosting Christmas for the extended family, and it became
  clear that we were all on the same wavelength of keeping things
  relaxing and low key.  Yesterday evening was hoodies, sweats, takeout
  Italian food.  The name of the game was comfort.</p>
<p>We also spent a lot of time crashing on the couch and watching Gold
  Rush, which I have to say, after being on the fence about the show, it
  finally won me over.  The crew was already short on staff, and it got
  so bad that they had to recruit the cook to drive a truck.  Then they
  found that the retaining pond built to catch silt had broken overnight
  due to the rain, and the boys had to scramble to fix it.  In the
  process, that rolled a rock truck, and a tire dislodged.  Not having
  the tools to fix the tire, they had to make a small explosion with
  ether and a blowtorch to cause the rubber to expand and seat the tire.
  In short, I find the amount of drama you can fit into an hour of gold
  digging pretty impressive.  Perhaps that&#8217;s the <i>real</i> gold.  Think
  about it.</p>
<p>I jumped in the car with Tom to go pick up dinner from Victoria&#8217;s,
  which happens to be the same restaurant Marissa used to work at in
  high school.  Do you tip for takeout?  Tom and I debated the custom in
  the car on the way over.  &#8220;You can&#8217;t just tip everybody,&#8221; I said.
  &#8220;You have to draw a line somewhere.&#8221;  Tom gave a stoic nod, signaling
  his agreement.</p>
<p>As we were driving, Tom told me a bit about Rochester.  &#8220;Even though
  the twin cities are bigger, Rochester is the fastest growing city,&#8221; he
  described as we coasted through city traffic.  &#8220;There are lots of new
  restaurants coming up to,&#8221; he continued.  He gestured to a passing
  restaurant, &#8220;I like to take clients there, although it&#8217;s pretty
  expensive,&#8221; he chuckled.</p>
<p>After dinner, we transitioned to gifts.  Rodney opened up lots of new
  additions to his train table - trucks, cranes, train cars.  If he had
  the awareness, he might begin to wonder if this Santa thing was a
  conspiracy.  After opening a train table on Christmas morning, he sure
  has been receiving a lot of gifts that are suspiciously complementary.
  &#8220;Dude,&#8221; I warned, &#8220;that Santa guy knows stuff, he&#8217;s been busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marissa got Renee a painting, and Tom opened up his new foldable saw.
  With how many hunting and outdoor gadgets adorn Tom&#8217;s very cool
  mancave, I was half expecting him to have already bought this hack
  saw, but to our relief, this was a new addition.</p>
<p>After cleaning up from presents, Marissa and I put Rodney to bed, then
  joined Renee and Tom up in the kitchen for drinks.  Tom and Renee
  broke out the apple pie flavored moonshine, which hit the spot, and
  felt a lot more festive than beer.  We chatted at the kitchen island
  about the tradeoffs of the holiday season.  &#8220;Everybody hates it,&#8221; I
  said.  &#8220;You can see it in peoples&#8217; eyes at Target, they&#8217;re returning
  things, running errands, and everyone just looks dead,&#8221; I remarked.  I
  motioned at Marissa.  &#8220;She calls me a Christmas hater, but most people
  agree with me on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marissa chimed in.  &#8220;I agree, but I haven&#8217;t lost my Christmas spirit.
  I still love it,&#8221; she stated proudly.  Renee nodded.  Marissa and her
  mother share an intense love and pride in the amount of effort they
  put into Christmas.  Just as Marissa will stay up into the wee hours
  of the night assembling toys, Renee will do the same with gifts and
  treats.</p>
<p>We all exchanged hugs, then Marissa and I retreated to the basement
  and stayed up for a few more hours chatting.  Before heading
  downstairs, Renee peeked her head into the kitchen.  &#8220;I saw in your
  blog you titled it &#8216;burning plastic&#8217;, what was that about?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>I smiled.  &#8220;That&#8217;s just the story about my modem burning out,&#8221; I
  replied.  &#8220;You know, clickbait.&#8221;  I shrugged my shoulders.  It&#8217;s true,
  sometimes I give stories a jazzier name to attract readers.</p>
<p>We finally turned in sometime around midnight.  I fell asleep
  immediately, and sailed away to sleep.  I didn&#8217;t even have any weird,
  elaborate nightmares I usually have while traveling away from my home.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling pretty good this morning.  &#8220;Ever since I started taking my
  own pillow places, my sleep game has been on another level,&#8221; I boasted
  coming up the stairs.  And it&#8217;s true - I take my little blue
  cylindrical neck pillow everywhere with me, and with the way I talk it
  up to people, you&#8217;d think I was making commission on these.  Marissa
  was even singing its praises yesterday after she borrowed it for a car
  nap.</p>
<p>My neck pillow helps, but I&#8217;m sure what really did it was sleeping in.
  Rodney climbed out of his bed in the corner sometime around 9:30, and
  his clambering and tumbling around our bed eventually woke up Marissa
  too.</p>
<p>This morning, I&#8217;m wearing my brand new Bears Jersey, which I opened up
  last night.  Tom and Renee kindly bought be an immersion blender as
  well as an Ackiem Hicks Bears jersey.  I put it on last night, and
  after coming up the stairs with it on this morning, the family
  teasingly accused me of sleeping in it.  Which I can neither conform,
  nor deny at this time.</p>
<p>So this morning, we&#8217;re finishing up breakfast, and the plan is to head
  to Forager to retrieve Marissa&#8217;s paintings, which have been hanging on
  display there through the holiday season.  And we will probably stay
  there for lunch and a beer.  But first, we&#8217;re going to drink the rest
  of this coffee, watch a few more episodes of Gold Rush, and I&#8217;ll
  casually pace by the bathroom mirror a few more times to get a proud
  look at my new Bears jersey.  Man, it even smells good.  Nothing beats
  fresh jersey smell.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  Hope you have a wonderful day, and thanks
  for reading.  Here&#8217;s to time off for the holiday, and soon a new
  beginning in a new decade.  Oh, and happy Friday!</p>
