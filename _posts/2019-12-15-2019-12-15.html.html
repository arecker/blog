<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re all feeling good today.  Today is
  another agility day - Mom and the dogs left early this morning, and
  it&#8217;s just the Rodman and I.  I&#8217;m taking things pretty slow this
  morning and letting Rodney get some extra sleep.  He&#8217;s feeling much
  better - it seems like his energy has back, and now we&#8217;re just left
  with occasional heavy coughing and, of course, lots of boogers.
  Boogers are absolutely everywhere.  We&#8217;re almost at teething levels of
  booger production.  And while I will not spend any more time talking
  about the levels of boogers we&#8217;re dealing with here, just know it&#8217;s a
  lot of boogers.</p>
<p>Today is game day!  This morning I have the Chicago Bears on my mind.
  We play the Packers at Lambeau field at noon today.  I&#8217;m pretty
  nervous about the game.  Football has showed me that I&#8217;m more
  superstitious than I thought.  Even though we&#8217;re on a four game
  winning streak, three of those games, I was either out and about at
  the museum, in Minnesota for Thanksgiving, or at the actual game.  I
  haven&#8217;t watched a game from home in a while.  And my superstitious
  brain is making me worried that if I watch the game, I&#8217;ll somehow make
  it harder for the Bears to win.  Also, being at the game where Mitch
  and his offense finally started clicking, it doesn&#8217;t yet seem real.
  Ironically, I need to see him play that well on TV before I start
  believing it&#8217;s not a fluke.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also pretty worried about the symmetry with last season. If I&#8217;m
  not mistaken, last year when the Bears beat the Packers in Lambeau
  field, it was the Packers who were just one game from playoff
  contention elimination.  With the Bears on the brink of elimination
  themselves, the situation this season seems similar and ominously
  reversed.</p>
<p>At least it&#8217;s an earlier game.  I like the noon games much better than
  the evening ones.  I find it kind of difficult to focus on cooking
  dinner during the Bears game.  But a noon game is usually wrapped up
  around the time we put Rodney down for a nap.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  I enjoyed getting an early start
  yesterday.  Getting up around 8 gave me plenty of time to write, clean
  the kitchen, and set Rodney up at the Breakfast table.  Later, as he
  played with blocks, I played some Christmas music and did my first
  bing reading session of the new Difficult conversations book.  Thus
  far, it&#8217;s a great book.  The only unfortunate part is that the
  terminology in the book is undeniably <i>corporate</i>, almost a little
  retro - like something reminiscent of an HR mandated training video
  made in the 90s.  As I was trying to summarize what I learned to
  Marissa later that evening, I struggled to pick words that didn&#8217;t make
  the concepts sound boring.</p>
<p>The case examples are also hilariously dated.  To illustrated &#8220;blame&#8221;,
  the book asked you to imagine that your secretary sent you to a
  business presentation with the wrong briefcase.  Maybe it&#8217;s just my
  line of work, but I have never actually seen anyone carrying a
  briefcase full of papers.</p>
<p>But overall the book is compelling, and I&#8217;m learning a lot.  And it&#8217;s
  already one of those books that I wish Marissa and I had when we first
  got married.  On one hand, I&#8217;m proud that we&#8217;ve arrived at the same
  conclusions preached by this book - rules like &#8220;intentions are
  invisible, never assume them&#8221; and &#8220;blame inhibits problem solving&#8221; -
  even if it took us a couple of fights to get there.  Looking back at
  our marriage, the thing I&#8217;m most proud of is how much we studied our
  own arguments.  It&#8217;s tempting to argue, apologize, then sweep things
  under the rug, but I think there is a lot to learn from fights, and
  even if it was two in the morning and our voices were hoarse from
  yelling, Marissa and I always took the time to make sure we both
  understood what happened.</p>
<p>One of the concepts we tried to pioneer early in our marriage was a
  &#8220;reoccurring fight&#8221;.  We had a some fights that would crop up every
  month or so, and though the subject matter would be different, our
  defense mechanisms, habits, values, and diverging perspectives felt
  the same.  It sort of reminded me of when I learned I could be trapped
  into losing a game of tic-tac-toe after my first move.  If they go
  center, and you take any non corner space, you&#8217;ve already lost the
  game.  Some of our fights felt like a common chain reaction, and even
  though there was no way to stop them once they started, they could be
  avoided if you just anticipate the scenario that got you there in the
  first place.</p>
<p>After spending the morning reading, I heated up some lunch for Rodney.
  Afterwards, Rodney helped me sort some laundry, then &#8220;fix&#8221; a laptop.
  Marissa&#8217;s old computer stopped booting, and it had been sitting in my
  closet waiting to be worked on.  The plan was to take out the hard
  drive, stick it in a working computer, and wipe the drive so it could
  be safely recycled.  Rodney sat at the table while I worked, and to
  let him feel involved I set him up with some spare computer parts.
  Marissa called us while we were working, and while the phone was on
  speaker Rodney excitedly talked about how he was fixing her broken
  laptop.  &#8220;That must be what he thinks you do everyday,&#8221; Marissa joked
  later that night.  I laughed, picturing a life where my job was just
  to jam screwdrivers and spare parts into old, broken laptops.  Some
  days while working, it certainly feels like that might as well be my
  job.  The joke is a great metaphor for the imposter syndrome and
  futility.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  Rodney is starting to wake up.  I can
  hear his loud, phlegmmy barking up in his upstairs bedroom.  How lucky
  for him to get a free week long cough added to his cold &amp; fever at no
  extra charge.  In a moment, I&#8217;ll head upstairs, get him out of bed,
  and get him ready for the day.  We&#8217;re both wearing our Bears swag
  today.  This year my Secret Ditka thoughtfully included a new kids
  sized bears hat for Rodney.  It took some convincing to get him to
  wear it, but my son has a real trust problem when it comes to new
  hats.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Bear down, and have a
  restful Sunday.</p>
