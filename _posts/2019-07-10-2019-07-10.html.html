<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Yesterday was very productive.  I think I finally got the catch-up day
  that I needed.  In the morning I beefed up the first few weeks of
  planned work for the summer interns, then I made an agenda for our
  first meeting.  I went for a quick trot around the square and picked
  up some food from a food cart.  It was a new one that I have never
  tried - a food card called &#8220;braisen hussies&#8221; or something like that.
  I brought the braised pork rice bowl back to my desk.  It was pretty
  good, the black beans and rice were really tasty, and it even had
  little bits of pork rinds sprinkled throughout.  While I ate my lunch,
  I watched some recipe videos to plan dinner and pick something to make
  for Wednesday&#8217;s concert on the square.</p>
<p>At first, I was thinking about making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0G5Y2SOW0c">Babish&#8217;s Chicken Quesadillas</a>.  I
  made them once before, and although they were a little involved, they
  turned out pretty good.  But half way through the watching the video
  again, it was starting to look like a poor choice for Tuesday night.
  It&#8217;s a solid recipe, but cutting and marinating chicken, frying the
  chicken, dicing and sauteeing vegetables, assembling the quesadillas,
  and then finally frying the quesadillas sounded like too much work for
  a weekday, especially since I had another meal to cook afterwards.  In
  the end, I decided to just toss some cod fillets in breadcrumbs and
  fry them for dinner.  For concert on the square, I had a fun idea to
  make vegetarian crunchwrap supremes.  They have this meatless chorizo
  made from soy that looks (and tastes) a lot like ground beef, and
  getting vegetarian refried beans is just a matter of finding a can
  without lard listed in the ingredients.  I set out all the
  ingredients, including the meatless chorizo which I jazzed up with
  some taco seasoning and olive oil, and Marissa formed them into little
  tortilla polygons while I made some guac.</p>
<p>After carefully setting the tower of crunchwrap supremes in the
  fridge, we settled in on the couch to knock out another episode of
  Stranger Things.  We watched the second to last episode, and as
  expected, there were some more odd choices in the plot line that had
  us really scratching our heads.  I&#8217;ll also add that there are some
  serious pacing issues - for being the second to last episode in the
  season, things got really slow all of the sudden.</p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m working from home.  This will be my last work-from-home
  Wednesday in a while, so I&#8217;ll be sure to savor this one and get a lot
  of work done.  Marissa has agility class this morning, so it&#8217;s just me
  and the Rod man hanging out.  After she gets back, we&#8217;re going to walk
  to Glass Nickel for lunch and a beer.  Usually after lunch on
  Wednesdays, Marissa and Rodney take a nap on the couch and I finish
  the workday while playing a movie in the background.  Today, I&#8217;m
  feeling <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>.  Seriously, that&#8217;s a movie that I feel
  like watching any time, any day.  At some point in the afternoon
  before we leave for concert on the square, I have to fry those little
  tortilla polygons in butter.  And maybe eat one.  As - you know -
  quality assurance.  What kind of lunatic would bring food to share
  without tasting it first?</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s Wednesday.  I can&#8217;t believe the week is already half over.
  Here&#8217;s to a fast week and a slow weekend.  OK team, let&#8217;s have a
  Wednesday!</p>
