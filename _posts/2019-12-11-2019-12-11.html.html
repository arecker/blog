excerpt: confrontation and cabbage

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re doing well today.  This morning,
  I&#8217;m working from home, but I&#8217;m trying to get an early jump on the day
  and stick to the regular schedule of things.</p>
<p>Rod is finally starting to feel better.  His fever went away, and he
  felt good enough to run errands with mom, and later go to Hy-Vee with
  me.  He still has a pretty nasty cough, but through his exasperated,
  phlegmmy voice he&#8217;s still just as talkative as ever.  So for anyone
  that wished him a speedy recovery, know that he&#8217;s turning a corner and
  he&#8217;s back to his rigorous daily routine of watching TV, chasing the
  dogs around, and occasionally peeing in the potty.  He&#8217;s still not
  feeling well enough to help out in the kitchen.  Since he was feeling
  better yesterday, I offered to make dinner with him, but I got his
  classic <i>no daase</i> as he stared out the car window.  Then he spotted
  the moon outside, so we were already on to the next thing.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day, although I didn&#8217;t get as much done as
  I wanted to.  It was one of those days that kind of slipped away, lost
  to reading slack messages and email and attending meetings.  I had a
  pretty good one-on-one with my boss - I shared that I have a problem
  with confrontation.  I&#8217;m not even talking about serious
  confrontations - getting rear ended in traffic, or having to go tell
  someone to get off your lawn.  I seem to have a problem with small
  confrontations - the kind where it just seems easier to nod and go
  along with things instead of ruffling feathers.</p>
<p>He recommended a book to me, and I ended up ordering it.  Those little
  book previews in Amazon are pretty effective, aren&#8217;t they?  I Must
  have read through half the first chapter before I even forgot what I
  was doing.  The book is by some Harvard people who studied how
  difficult conversations take place, and in the first chapter, it
  described how alongside all difficult conversations, there is a
  hidden, personal conversation people have with themselves.  Both
  parties are judging everything through a lens, using it to measure
  whether or not they seem competent, tough, lovable, and overall living
  up to their own ideals.</p>
<p>For instance, two young parents who are arguing about which parenting
  book to follow are probably not actually looking for alternative
  suggestions - it&#8217;s more likely about who is a better, savvier parent.
  Two college students arguing about politics are probably just trying
  to prove to themselves that they don&#8217;t live in a bubble, and that they
  know what&#8217;s going on in the world.</p>
<p>The idea makes me feel kind of dirty.  I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about
  talking to people and, rather than taking what they&#8217;re saying at face
  value, you play a little game where you try to imagine <i>why</i> they are
  saying what they&#8217;re saying.  I certainly don&#8217;t try to have secret
  conversations in my head.  I&#8217;m one of those people that says whatever
  pops into their head.  But it struck a chord with me, and the examples
  in the book sounded a lot like some puzzling confrontations I&#8217;ve had
  in the past, so I bought the book.  I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s one of those
  little thin paperback books that I can blow through in one wild
  weekend of binge reading.</p>
<p>After kind of a heavy, thoughtful afternoon, I ended the day on a high
  note.  Somebody from our San Francisco office reached out to me for
  some python help, and before our late afternoon meeting I tried to be
  intentional about putting some coherent thoughts together.  She was
  starting out on a new project where she was asked to bring a big,
  multi contributor project under better testing and logging, so we
  spent the half hour looking through the code and talking about some
  strategies for refactoring it - and for the uninitiated, <i>refactor</i> is
  a silly industry pseudo-word that just means <i>change the code without
  changing what it does</i>.  So it was a pretty fun, stimulating
  conversation about a topic I enjoy.</p>
<p>After work, I took Rod to Hy-Vee.  He had practically skipped all his
  meals the day before, so I wanted to put a lot of vegetables and
  potatoes on his plate that evening.  We picked up potatoes, ground
  beef, kale, and red cabbage.  Once at home, Rod crashed on the couch
  to watch some TV.  I was kind of bummed he didn&#8217;t want to help in the
  kitchen, but he still looks the kind of sick where you wake up at 80%,
  then before dinner feel about 50%, so I can relate.</p>
<p>I quartered and boiled the potatoes with chopped kale, mixed the
  ground beef with an egg, bread crumbs, and spices, then rolled the
  meat in puff pastry.  They may have been my best saucijzenbroodjes
  ever.  I feel like I&#8217;m starting to really hit a good stride in the
  kitchen.  Lately it feels like I&#8217;m getting faster, and I can either
  use the extra time to put food on the table earlier, or just enjoy
  spending extra time on something to get it right.  As the broodjes
  finished in the oven, I cut some cabbage and cooked it in my biggest
  pan in some hot oil, and taking a tip from Rachel Ray, I jazzed it up
  with some mustard seeds.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t cooked red cabbage, I would give it a try.  It looks
  really cool.  The dark purple brightens up, and it even leaves this
  regal sheen in the pan.  Later that night as I cleaned the pan in the
  sink, the water ran purple, then deep blue like squid ink.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  Today, I&#8217;m working from home, and Marissa
  is taking the dogs to class.  The Rod man is probably going to sleep
  in, and I&#8217;m hoping he does, and finally beats that dang cough &amp; cold.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Thanks for reading, and
  hey - Happy Wednesday!</p>
