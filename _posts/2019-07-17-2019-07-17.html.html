<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  The interns and I are clicking
  pretty well, and by gosh are they smart.  Aside from the stand-ups in
  the morning, they pretty much just do their own thing all day.  I had
  a few meetings in the morning, then I heated up some leftover stamppot
  for lunch.  In the afternoon, I picked off a few tickets from our
  backlog.</p>
<p>On the way home from work, Marissa told me that we were going to
  concert on the square after all.  We were planning on heading to a
  goodbye party for some agility friends in Rockford, but our car&#8217;s air
  conditioning is broken, and Marissa driving it around all day in the
  hot summer weather must have inspired the change of plans.  So I had
  to quickly plan a meal to bring to the concert on the bus ride on the
  way home.</p>
<p>It was pretty short notice, but I think it turned out pretty well.  I
  made a stuffing featured in Stefan&#8217;s <a href="french mushroom ">Oefs Chimay</a> that used butter,
  shallots, and diced mushrooms.  Once all the cutting was complete, the
  recipe was very easy, as I just needed to let the water evaporate off
  of the mushrooms.  A few minutes in, it looks like a bit wet disaster,
  but slowly over about twenty minutes the stuffing dries, concentrating
  the flavors and leaving a much more appetizing texture.</p>
<p>Once the stuffing cooled, I hard boiled a half dozen eggs and popped
  the yolks out, then I mashed them into the stuffing.  I added some
  chopped bacon as well.  Lastly, I halved a few bell peppers, hallowed
  them out, and filled them.  My only regret was not making enough
  stuffing.  Throwing everything into the pot, it looked like I had
  enough food to feed several people, but man do those mushrooms just
  shrink up when they lose their water!  I barely had enough for a taste
  test.</p>
<p>In other kitchen news, we bought a twelve inch cast iron skillet, and
  I think I&#8217;m in love.  It can get really hot, obviously, but yesterday
  I was reading about all the advantages of cast iron, and they&#8217;re
  pretty compelling.  Did you know they form their own natural non stick
  surface?  If you expose oils to eat beyond their smoke point (which is
  easy to do, because cast iron heats up like a freakin&#8217; meteor), they
  break down, polymerize, and bond to the metal itself.  A cast iron
  skillet should be able to fry an egg without anything sticking.
  They&#8217;re also virtually indestructible, and even the most hideous,
  rusted, neglected cast iron ware can be restored anew by stripping it
  with oven cleaner.</p>
<p>And cleaning it isn&#8217;t as bad as I thought.  You can wash it in the
  sink with soap and hot water.  And after you pat it down with a towel,
  you just need to leave it on the hot stove for a minute or two to heat
  away any excess water.  Once it cools down, you can just wipe it down
  with a little bit of mineral oil.</p>
<p>Last night, after frying the bacon for the stuffing, Marissa slacked
  me a message asking me if I was down for making some french toast as a
  snack, and of course I was.  I will literally make french toast for
  anyone that asks at any hour of the day.  Plus, it was another excuse
  to bust out the cast iron skillet.  The cast iron worked beautifully,
  I feel like I was able to really smell the eggs and the milk while
  they browned in the butter.</p>
<p>Today should be a pretty good day.  I&#8217;m heading into the office so I
  can hang out with the interns.  Our team&#8217;s ticket duty board is in a
  pretty good state, so I think I have the bandwidth to work on
  something a little more substantive.  And after work, we&#8217;re going to
  enjoy some stuffed red peppers at concert on the square.  And if
  you&#8217;re reading this, I hope you have a good day too.</p>
