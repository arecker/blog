<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>I really need to read more.  I&#8217;ve been staring at my bookshelf for the
  past few minutes, waiting for the coffee to kick in, and I got looking
  at the books on my shelf.  Most of the books are non-fiction.  I have
  a whole bunch of textbooks from school that I kept around, as well as
  a handful of programming books.  I&#8217;ve always had a hard time getting
  into non-fiction, and I think that&#8217;s because I consider time spent on
  a bad piece of fiction is time wasted.  Text books, on the other hand,
  are a little more forgiving.  Even if the book is not great at
  explaining things and you are having a hard time connecting to the
  examples, I usually still benefit from just spending time trying to
  learn something.  I think sometime last year I tried to learn C.  I
  picked up this book from Barnes and Noble called &#8220;learn C in 30 days&#8221;.
  You can do amazing things in C, and a lot of really smart people
  demonstrate that.  And after reading the book and working through the
  examples, I wouldn&#8217;t claim to be an expert.  But I think I learned
  just enough C to decide that I don&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p><i>Learn C in 30 Days</i> is leaning up against Peter Siebel&#8217;s <i>Practical
  Common Lisp</i>.  I think I only battled half way through the book before
  it fell by the wayside.  It was good, but the ironic thing is it just
  wasn&#8217;t feeling very practical.  I stopped trying to write Lisp because
  it was too hard to find examples of Lisp that were actually
  accomplishing something other than teaching someone how to write lisp.</p>
<p>All that to say is I feel like I need a new book.  Speaking of books,
  my sister told me yesterday that my mom has had her Amazon account
  since 1998, and you can still look all the way back in the purchase
  history to see what books we were buying (you know, back when Amazon
  just sold books).  One of my first purchases from Amazon through my
  mom&#8217;s account was a book called <i>The Mars Diaries</i>.  It was a book
  series about this kid who was raised on a human Mars colony and, when
  he was a baby, had surgery that would allow him to control robots.
  There were five of them in the series, I think, and I read them all.
  You know for someone who hates fiction, I really miss the feeling of
  getting swept up into that story.</p>
<p>I also have a few comic books on the bottom shelf.  In college, I
  tried to really get into them.  I had a few when I was really little,
  and I guess I was trying to use that as my foot-in-the-door to get
  into a new hobby later in life.  I bought those on Amazon.  A few
  years ago, I tried perusing the comic book store near our house.  I
  attempted to talk shop with the guy and throw around my knowledge of
  how they had recently completely rebooted the Spider-Man storyline by
  allowing mephisto to reset the timeline and send an older, married
  Peter Parker back to high school to a time where he never met Mary
  Jane, but the classic smug comic book store guy (who honestly could
  have been right out of a Simpson&#8217;s episode) quickly sniffed me out as
  an imposter and informed me my information was at least a decade old,
  and Miles Morales was Spider-Man now.</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;m out of time.  I got to get to work.  Let&#8217;s have a great
  Thursday, everyone!</p>
