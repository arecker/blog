<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Saturday.  This morning, I&#8217;m up a
  little early to get a jump on things.  By 10 AM, we hope to have the
  car packed and ready to hit the road.  This weekend, Marissa is having
  a meet and greet at a restaurant up in Minnesota, so if you happen to
  be in the lovely little city of Rochester this afternoon, stop by
  Forager brewery and say hi!</p>
<p>Even though we will probably be in a hurry this morning, I still
  blended the ingredients together for a Dutch baby.  At the moment, my
  cast iron pan is heating up in the oven with clarified butter.  The
  plan is to write a journal entry, then dump the batter in, and twenty
  minutes later I&#8217;ll just casually sit it out on the table to tempt
  Marissa and Rodney while we&#8217;re packing up.  The great thing about
  breakfast is you never need to ask permission to make it.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty wonderful day.  Throughout the day, I got two
  packages delivered to me at work.  They were two pieces to the new
  computer case I&#8217;m going to try on the router.  I felt very obnoxious
  folding the big stack of cardboard at my desk.  My boss teased, &#8220;what
  do you think this is the UPS store?&#8221;  The open air case will have to
  wait until Sunday, I didn&#8217;t get a chance to break it open yesterday.</p>
<p>When I got home, Marissa was teetering on the edge of a nap.  Rodney
  was climbing on her, and even the dogs looked annoyed.  &#8220;Want to go to
  Hy-Vee, dude?&#8221; I asked, as Marissa&#8217;s sleepy eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Rodney and I drove to Hy-Vee, and we took our time.  I let him check
  out the new holiday toy aisle, we snacked on some bread, and we looked
  through the kitchen section for a funnel.  We didn&#8217;t find it.  The
  Hy-Vee kitchen utensils section has an amazing way of disappointing me
  every time, no matter what I&#8217;m looking for.  We did, however, pick up
  some potatoes, a sirloin steak, cream cheese, kimchi, and sandwich
  buns.  It was philly cheese steak night, but this time I wasn&#8217;t going
  to succumb to usual bag of frozen french fries - I was going to try to
  make my own.</p>
<p>When we got home, Marissa was still asleep on the couch, so I did my
  best to keep Rodney busy in the kitchen.  We peeled the potatoes, then
  cut them into fry shapes, which wasn&#8217;t nearly as hard as I thought it
  would be.  For a while, I&#8217;ve assumed that there was a difficult trick
  to cutting every type of vegetable, and that has held me back.  I&#8217;ve
  found instead that most of them just come down to common sense - just
  picture what you want to end up with, and try something.</p>
<p>We tossed the delicate little shoestring shaped potatoes in some cold
  water and rinsed, then dumped them out onto a paper towel.  I put
  Rodney on drying duty.  He tamped them dry with more paper towels as I
  dumped two bottles of corn oil into my Dutch oven.  We slipped the
  fries into the cold oil.  Rodney threw the last few in from as high as
  he could, and the oil splashed onto my face.  &#8220;PERFECT,&#8221; he yelled as
  I dabbed the oil off of my nose and chin.  I clicked the stove to HIGH
  and we moved on to the steak.  Rodney helped me salt the steak while I
  flipped and dried it, then we threw it on to some smoking hot olive
  oil in my biggest pan.  As it seared, we chopped some white onions.
  Rodney actually managed to chop one of the onion quarters in half with
  a butter knife.  He handed me the chunks, then started to rub his
  eyes.  &#8220;Dad, crying?&#8221;  I looked at him, and saw a tear rolling down
  his face.  I laughed.  &#8220;Oh dude, cutting onions makes you cry.  You&#8217;re
  crying, even though you&#8217;re not sad.  Isn&#8217;t that weird?&#8221;  He repeated
  the fun fact aloud to himself a few more times.</p>
<p>We dropped the slices of white onion around the steak and seasoned
  with salt.  The kitchen air started to bloom with the aroma of burning
  meat and onions.  Rodney and I cut the sandwich buns.  After I
  finished cutting the middle out of two of them, I looked over and saw
  Rodney was just ripping one of them up into pieces.  &#8220;Oh nice dude,
  that&#8217;s PERFECT,&#8221; I said as I moved the other buns out of his reach.
  That one would keep him busy for a while.  I was happy we bought a
  small french load to split while shopping, because I was able to use
  the rest of it for the missing sandwich bun.</p>
<p>The steak finished cooking, and Rodney and I combined cream cheese,
  the grilled onions, sliced steak, provolone cheese, chopped kimchi,
  and just a squirt of Korean hot pepper paste.  Marissa joined us in
  the kitchen after emerging from her nap.  Just as I was sliding the
  assembled sandwiches into the oven, I glanced over at the fries.  To
  my delight, they were golden brown, floating on top the oil.  They
  took about 45 minutes, and at no time did I have to measure the temp
  of the oil or adjust the heat.  I scooped the fries onto a paper towel
  and sprinkled them liberally with salt.  Marissa and I sampled one,
  and in the best way possible they tasted like they were fresh from the
  McDonald&#8217;s across the street.</p>
<p>We sat down and ate dinner, then spent an extra twenty minutes at the
  table goofing around and eating some ice cream for dessert.  I grabbed
  baby giraffe and put on an impromptu puppet show in the kitchen, using
  my arm to make it look like the giraffe was snatching my hat off my
  head.  &#8220;It&#8217;s funny because even though I can see your whole arm and
  elbow, Rodney thinks it&#8217;s hilarious,&#8221; Marissa remarked.</p>
<p>After Rodney went to bed, Marissa and I caught up on chores, then
  finished the night off by watching the Matirx.  I fell asleep on the
  couch with Ziggy in my lap.  It was a good night.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I got today.  Hope you all have a great weekend.  As for
  me, I probably need to get this Dutch baby in the oven and start
  waking my family.  We need to hit the road in about an hour and a
  half.  Thanks for reading, everyone.</p>
