<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  It&#8217;s a wonderful day, isn&#8217;t it?  It&#8217;s only
  Sunday and I&#8217;ve had so much sleep, I barely feel the need to drink any
  coffee today.  I still will drink coffee, because going without coffee
  in the morning would be absolutely crazy.  Speaking of coffee, the
  Moccamaster is still absolutely killing it.  I think we found our
  coffee maker for life.  The smaller pot was a little strange to get
  used to (it&#8217;s only 10 cups as opposed to the usual 12), but conversely
  it magically takes about five minutes to brew a new pot.  I don&#8217;t know
  how it heats up the water so quickly, but it&#8217;s a joy to watch.</p>
<p>And my metal filter finally arrived in the mail - it fits much better
  than the flat paper ones I was using.  Unbeknownst to us, the package
  had been sitting in front of our side door for a month, and while
  stepping out to drop off some cookies with our neighbors, Marissa
  stumbled across it.  I guess we need to check that door for mail
  occasionally.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty great day too.  We all slept in and got a late
  start, then Marissa took Rodney out running some errands, leaving me
  at home with the dogs to work on my mixtape.  I worked on it pretty
  much the whole day, ordering and editing tracks, arriving at just shy
  of 160MB of music.  I didn&#8217;t do any writing, but now I&#8217;m on the fence
  about it.  I might instead put time into just making a cool CD cover
  and burning more copies.  I think the mix turned out pretty good this
  year.  I gave it a test run while I showered and got dressed, and it
  has got good momentum and decent variety.</p>
<p>After Marissa returned home with Rodney, we all jumped in the car
  again and went to Hy-Vee to pick up dinner.  I decided to make Chef
  John&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6OSMbfhIao">Greek lemon garlic roasted chicken &amp; potatoes</a>, which has been
  camping out in my favorites for a while.  We picked up some drumsticks
  and thighs, russet potatoes, kale, and salad dressing.  By the time we
  got home, it was already 6:30, so I decided to serve the kale salad
  first, which had sliced apples, grapefruit, a raspberry dressing, and
  just a whole hecking ton of roasted sunflower seeds.  While we munched
  on salad and some bread, I roasted the potatoes and chicken in the
  oven, tossed in lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and spices, and basted
  in some chicken broth.  It turned out really good, and I think it will
  definitely be returning as a weeknight recipe.</p>
<p>We put Rodney to bed, then Marissa and I spent the rest of the night
  hanging out.  I decided to play some video games, and being in the
  mood for some nostalgia, I spun up <i>Splinter Cell: Conviction</i>, which
  was a game released in 2010 that I was deeply obsessed with in
  college.  The game really holds up.  As I started the first level, all
  the muscle memory ingrained in my fingers from hours of playing that
  game returned, and to my delight I expertly zipped through the first
  four levels.  Marissa came downstairs and joined me on the couch.</p>
<p>&#8220;So bring me up to speed here, what&#8217;s this game about?&#8221; Marissa asked.
  I took a minute to gather my thoughts while absentmindedly choking out
  a guard in the shadows.  &#8220;Well Sam Fischer is like this government
  agent special ops dude,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;And he thought his daughter died,
  but it turns out it was a set-up.  And it wasn&#8217;t even his daughter,
  and she might be alive.  And the lady talking in my headset is Anna
  Grimmsdotter, and she&#8217;s working as a mole for my old agency which is
  now run by this bad dude named Tom Reid&#8230;&#8221;, my voice trailed off as I
  struggled to unpack the rest of the plot.  &#8220;You know what,&#8221; I said
  interrupted myself.  &#8220;It&#8217;s not really the kind of game where you need
  to understand the plot to enjoy it.&#8221;  Marissa nodded, undoubtedly
  relieved that she could check out from my meandering recap.  As Sam, I
  was sneaking around a little carnival in front of the Washington
  Monument.  Some dudes sent to <i>take me out</i> evacuated the carnival
  under the premise of a gas leak, and were now stalking the labyrinth
  of rides and attractions looking for Sam.  We chuckled listening to
  the background dialog that would get louder as I approached an
  unsuspecting baddie.  &#8220;Guys, we wanted to get the jump on Sam, but I
  think the <i>opposite</i> is true.&#8221;  In all my years of playing this game,
  I don&#8217;t think even I&#8217;ve ever heard that line.  And it sounded very out
  of place.</p>
<p>Just before shutting off the game, I abandoned stealth and ran into
  broad daylight and attracted a furry of machine gun fire.  I wanted to
  see how long I could last.  After running in awkward figure eights
  beneath a spotlight amidst frantic shouting and machine gun fire, Sam
  Fischer finally slumped to the ground.  An EMP grenade I threw just
  before dying exploding, which looked especially cinematic.  I turned
  off the game, and Marissa and I used the last hour of the night to
  enjoy some popcorn and watch a movie.</p>
<p>Today, the plan is to go to church (which is quickly approaching, at
  the time of writing this we have about forty minutes before we need to
  jump in the car).  After church, we&#8217;re going to go to the grocery
  store, which is going to take some thought, since between traveling
  and holidays, we&#8217;ll need to get enough food in our house to last us
  through Christmas.  Sometime in the afternoon, my good buddy from
  college Grant is going to stop by on his way up to Wausau, so we&#8217;re
  looking forward to hanging out with him, and maybe even making him a
  snack to get him through the last leg of his drive.  Lastly, it&#8217;s game
  day.  The Bears are playing tonight at seven, and for the first time
  in a while, all three of us will be home to watch it together.  It
  might not be the most meaningful game of the season, but watching
  football together is fun on its own merit.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I got today.  Whatever you get up to, I hope you have a
  relaxing, yet productive weekend.  Bear down!</p>
