<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Happy Saturday.  This morning, I&#8217;m coming to
  you from our dining room computer.  Lion King is playing on the TV,
  Marissa is napping on the couch, and Rodney is burning off all the
  sugar he ate for breakfast.  It&#8217;s possible I put just a little too
  much sugar on his Dutch baby this morning.  But the sugar rush won&#8217;t
  last forever, I&#8217;m sure by the end of this entry, he&#8217;ll be mellowed
  out.</p>
<p>So last night was pretty action packed.  Marissa and I stayed up
  pretty late to kick off the holiday weekend, and sometime around two
  in the morning we heard a big crash outside.  Peering through the
  window, we saw somebody had slammed their car into my neighbor&#8217;s
  truck, which was parked on the street in front of his house.  The guy
  staggered out and looked pretty flustered.  He tried to start the car
  a few times and dislodge it from the curb, but he ended up just taking
  all his stuff out of the car and heading down the street on foot.
  Marissa called the cops, who told us they were already looking for a
  guy who was driving a stolen car that did a hit and run downtown
  earlier that night.</p>
<p>Before he fled, I walked down my driveway to try to get a look at his
  license plate.  To be honest with you, I was planning on confronting
  him.  My neighbor has had people hit his car and leave before, and we
  were pretty peeved it was happening again, and wanted to jump on the
  opportunity to finally hold somebody responsible.  But from the corner
  of my house, I could see that he was taking the license plate off
  anyway, then I had second thoughts about getting in his face.
  Usually, I regret not confronting people about this kind of thing, but
  after hearing everything from the cops, I&#8217;m glad I hung back.  He
  could have been dangerous.</p>
<p>So an eventful Friday night!  Marissa stayed up a little later to
  scope things out, but went to bed not long after me.  We&#8217;ll be
  glancing at the police ticker all day to see if they ended up getting
  him.</p>
<p>This morning, I channeled all the adrenaline into making breakfast.  I
  made a pair of Dutch babies, and just for the hell of it, some french
  toast.  After journaling, I&#8217;ll probably take Rod to the market to pick
  up stuff to make cornbread.  Afterwards, I&#8217;m smoking a slab of ribs.
  I have a good feeling about this batch.  The slab is from the Jenny
  Street market, and there&#8217;s a lot of meat between the ribs that looks
  dark and marbled.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Stay sharp out there, and
  when in doubt, just make breakfast.</p>
