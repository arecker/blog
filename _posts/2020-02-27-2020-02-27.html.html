<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Thursday.  I&#8217;ve just returned from
  picking up coffee for the morning.  Walking up the block and across
  the street to Willie Street&#8217;s Ground Zero Coffee has been a fun little
  morning routine this week.  This morning, while filling to-go cups at
  the coffee bar, I saw somebody casually walk through the door with a
  leashed dog and stand in line.  I mentally ear marked the occasion, in
  case I feel like going on an adventure with one or both of the dogs
  today.</p>
<p>I decided to work remote the rest of the week.  Rodney has been doing
  great here, but it&#8217;s tough keeping an eye on the dogs.  With no fence
  between us and the busy intersection of Jenny and Williamson, we&#8217;ve
  had to resort to leashing them up and walking them up the block to the
  same sad little grass spot to do their business.</p>
<p>I sure do miss just flinging the back door open and letting them tear
  into the back yard at will, and I&#8217;m sure they do to - especially
  Ziggy.  She seems to have a surplus of energy this week, darting
  around the house randomly, throwing her body on the rug and couch,
  almost as if she was charging a battery in her tiny body that ran on
  static electricity.  Last night while Marissa and I were trying to
  corral the dogs into the basement bedroom so we could turn in for the
  night, Ziggy stubbornly waited at a flight of stairs, wagging her
  tail.  She baited us back upstairs, acting like she had an urgent
  concern there, then proceeded to run around us in circles, biting
  Ollie&#8217;s neck, trying to entice him to join.  I abruptly called a
  <i>cease fire</i>, scooping Ziggy up in my arm and carrying her to bed like
  a handbag.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Marissa left for agility class with the dogs,
  leaving Rodney and I to hold it down at home.  Just before my 9:30
  meeting, I heard Rodney stirring and calling out on the baby monitor.
  I quickly changed him and set him up on the couch, where he contently
  picked at a bowl of cereal while watching YouTube.  During my stand-up
  meeting, his head and spacey eyes were barely visible from the corner
  of my webcam.  I got a good chuckle from the team, spinning the laptop
  around to prove that he does indeed like watching wordless water slide
  montages on YouTube in lieu of morning cartoons.</p>
<p>After morning stand-up, that was pretty much a wrap for the social
  component of my day.  And after gawking in the morning journal about
  going on a coffee shop adventure with Rodney, it dawned on me that I
  had the only house key, and it would be a bit cruel to hit the down
  and lock the door behind me when Marissa would be back within the
  hour.  And Rodney was pretty content with his never ending water slide
  montage playlist.  So we laid low the rest of the morning until
  Marissa returned.</p>
<p>For lunch, Marissa made PB&amp;J&#8217;s.  I also heated up some leftover soup.
  How did I make leftovers?  I&#8217;ve become something of a professional at
  rifling through this kitchen for makeshift solutions.  I found a few
  scrap gallon ziploc bags in the back of the cabinet.  Once the soup
  cooled, I poured it into a bag, propped up by a drinking glass.  When
  it was time to heat it up, I snipped the corner off the bag and
  squeezed it back into the glass, much like one might decorate a cake
  with a pastry bag.  I microwaved the tall cup of soup and proudly
  joined my family at the table for lunch.</p>
<p>After eating, Marissa left with Rodney to go work on her mural at
  Canine Sports Zone, this time leaving me home with the dogs.  I worked
  the rest of the afternoon, struggling to find a comfortable
  combination of room, chair, and shirt.  The upstairs of this house
  feels like a balmy 80 degrees, while the basement is a frigid dungeon.
  But despite the shuffling around, I managed to get a lot of work done.
  I cruised through some backlog tickets, and for the first time I had a
  chance to kick the tires on our new deployment tool.</p>
<p>Marissa returned and put Rodney down for a nap.  I packed my laptop
  and took a walk to the grocery store.  I love the long, straight walk
  to the Willie Street Co-op.  And sticking to simple stamppot
  ingredients, I didn&#8217;t rack up the kind of tab I&#8217;ve come to associate
  with the hip &amp; healthy neighborhood grocery store.  I grabbed some
  potatoes, a beautiful head of kale, some locally farmed sausage, and a
  loaf of parmesan &amp; peppercorn sourdough bread before making the
  exhilarating and chilly walk back to the house.</p>
<p>It only took a few minutes to peel the potatoes, rinse the kale, and
  get it in the dutch oven with water.  On an impulse, I also sliced up
  a leftover shallot and added it to the pot before laying the sausages
  on top.  I brought the Dutch oven to a simmer and covered it.  Rodney
  strolled into the kitchen, and I suddenly grew fascinated with how he
  was dealing with his boredom.  He leaned up against the fridge with
  his hands in his pockets, waiting for me to ask about his day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you have a good day, dude?&#8221; I asked.  Rodney&#8217;s eyes lit up.
  &#8220;Yeah&#8230; sports zone&#8230; talked to Shawna&#8217;jess&#8230; working.&#8221;  His voice
  trailed off as he looked at the near empty beer.  &#8220;Hey&#8230; wanna
  beercha?&#8221; said Rodney gesturing at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure dude, I&#8217;d love another,&#8221; I said, slamming the rest of it.
  Rodney heaved the fridge open and gingerly took my empty bottle,
  placing on the fridge in the shelf.  He handed me another, then helped
  himself to his milk.  He raised his glass to me and smirked.  We
  toasted, then he strolled away to play with his toys in the living
  room.</p>
<p>Hope you have a great Thursday today.  Here&#8217;s to one more day in the
  temporary house, and one more day of the work week.</p>
