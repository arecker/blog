<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  This is no slow morning around the breakfast
  table for us.  Today we&#8217;re looking to pack and hit the road by 10:30.
  We&#8217;re dropping the dogs off at the kennel, then heading to Minnesota.
  We expect the weather to be less than ideal, so once we start on the
  longest leg of the trip, we&#8217;re going to take it slow.  I&#8217;ll stock up
  on music, podcasts, paw patrol fruit snacks, and whatever else we need
  to get comfortable in long car rides.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  After breakfast, Rodney played in
  the living room while I caught up on chores and laundry.  It was a
  busy day, since I was working ahead for the time we&#8217;d be away from the
  house - chores double duty.  Which is absolutely worth it.  Marissa
  and I discovered that coming home from a long trip is about 100 times
  better if you put a little extra work into cleaning the house before
  you left.</p>
<p>Around lunch time, we say around the table and ate the rest
  of the leftovers in our fridge.  The leftover turkey meat from
  Sunday&#8217;s practice run dwindled, but what is interesting is that you
  can especially taste the brine now that the meat has had some time to
  rest in the fridge.  It kind of tastes like turkey meat you would buy
  at a deli.</p>
<p>After lunch, Marissa took Rodney to agility practice, leaving me and Ollie
  home alone.  Ollie napped in the living room while I caught up on some
  computer work.  Left home alone, we&#8217;re a pretty mellow duo.  Every
  thirty minutes or so I like to turn around and check in on Ollie and
  ask him what he&#8217;s up to.  His head will shoot up, alert, and the hair
  around his mouth will be flat from sleeping, like the dog version of
  bed-head.  Marissa returned from agility practice with Rodney and
  Ziggy and put Rodney down for a nap.  We hung out in the dining room,
  and I kept working on the computer.</p>
<p>When it came time to decide dinner, Marissa suggested Domino&#8217;s.  She
  smiled sheepishly as I deliberated.  Since I&#8217;ll find any excuse to
  cook, it&#8217;s not often I succumb to imperfect fast food cravings.  But I
  didn&#8217;t want to add any leftovers to our fridge, and I had to clean the
  whole kitchen anyway.  So I signed off on quick &amp; easy Domino&#8217;s
  dinner.</p>
<p>As Rodney napped, I took a trip to Hy-Vee.  I felt like getting out of
  the house, and even though it was raining, it was rush hour traffic,
  and Hy-Vee was already teeming with panicked, last minute Thanksgiving
  shoppers, it felt great to leave the house and do something.  I picked
  up some supplies for the brine, as well as some
  buckwheat flour.  I thought I would have to get that from a specialty
  grocery store, but my research found that it&#8217;s actually pretty
  common.  The only caveat is that sometimes regular flour can
  contaminate buckwheat flour if they&#8217;re prepared on the some equipment,
  so you have to find a bag that is <i>certified</i> gluten free.  I&#8217;m going
  to use it in the gravy, and since I&#8217;ve tasted some really good buckwheat
  pancakes and buckwheat noodles, I&#8217;m anticipating buckwheat gravy will
  be pretty good as well.</p>
<p>After getting home, I started a double batch of the brine on our
  stove.  The 20 cups of water barely fit in our largest pot, but it
  would work.  I went on to add 8 cups of brown sugar and 8 cups of
  flour.  It was fascinating to watch so much sugar and salt get
  swallowed up by the water.  Each scoop made a perfect <i>ploop</i> sound
  before sliding into the water already darkened by peppercorns.  I left
  the heat on low.</p>
<p>The pizza delivery guy rang the doorbell.  After we opened the door,
  Rodney immediately launched into a conversation about Sky from the paw
  patrol, asking him about her helicopter.  From the kitchen, I could
  hear his confused mumbling as he tried to figure out what Rodney was
  saying.  I kind of enjoy it when Rodney puts people on the spot.  He&#8217;s
  eager to talk to people, and it always makes for some interesting
  encounters.</p>
<p>We ate pizza on the couch and watched Mr. Bean.  I suppose the jury is
  still out as to whether or not Rodney enjoys that show, but it&#8217;s one
  of the few shows that we can all watch together.  Rodney stared
  blankly at the TV as we watched Mr. Bean paint his house with a paint
  bucket and a stick of dynamite.  I thought that scene would get a
  laugh out of him, but after Bean lit the fuse and raced to find his
  doorknob, Rodney turned to me and said &#8220;TOO SCARY&#8221;, which has kind of
  become his safe word with TV and movies.  Fair enough - back to
  Dinosaur Train.  We&#8217;ll have to give him another year or two to
  appreciate Mr. Bean.  To be fair, it&#8217;s a weird show.  It&#8217;s never clear
  whether or not you&#8217;re supposed to root for him.  He flicks his tongue
  around.  He&#8217;s generally a jackass to people.  But there are moments
  where you&#8217;re supposed to feel sorry for him, like when he tried
  throwing a New Year&#8217;s Eve party for his two buddies and they moved his
  clock forward to leave early.  He&#8217;s a complicated guy.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s getting to that time.  It&#8217;s past 9 now, and we&#8217;re getting
  dangerously close to being late.  We still have to pack our clothes,
  pack the car, and I think Marissa has some errands to run before we
  leave.  Wherever you are, if you&#8217;re traveling anywhere for
  Thanksgiving, go slowly.  Make sure you are locked and loaded on
  podcasts, mixtapes, and paw patrol fruit snacks.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a great day, and a wonderful Thanksgiving.</p>
