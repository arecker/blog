<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Last night may have been the quickest I&#8217;ve ever fell asleep.  Marissa
  and I turned in around 11:40, and I faded away very shortly after
  that.  I didn&#8217;t even check my phone or chat for a few minutes.  I was
  pretty exhausted from the full mid week day.  Yesterday was a cooking
  heavy day.  For dinner, I made a Caesar salad, which was surprisingly
  involved.  I was following a recipe that instructed me to make the
  sauce from scratch, and - most curiously - grill the lettuce.  I had
  some close calls with a few romaine leaves catching on fire and
  wilting into unappealing strands, but the moist hearts actually looked
  pretty good with a bit of char, and once mixed into the rest of the
  salad, it was easier to see what they were contributing.  The recipe
  also had instructions of how to make your own croutons, but I punted
  on that front and just bought a bag of good &#8216;ol Hy-Vee brand.  And I&#8217;m
  glad I did, otherwise me may have been eating dinner sometime around
  when I went to bed.</p>
<p>After cleaning up all the smoldering lettuce left over from dinner, we
  put Rod to bed.  Marissa worked on some tasks for the upcoming bridal
  shower this weekend while I made a little batch of faux meat
  saucijzenbroodjes for a friend.  I had some left over puff pastry, and
  running with a tip I got from my little sister I decided to bide my
  time by making some turnovers.  I didn&#8217;t have any apples on hand, but
  bananas did fine.  There&#8217;s very few things that don&#8217;t work in hot
  butter and sugar.  The turnovers puffed up really nicely - if I had
  known how easy these were, I would have bought a whole extra sleeve of
  puff pastry and made a proper batch!</p>
<p>We wrapped up chores and kitchen shenanigans some time around 11:00.
  I had a beer and watched some youtube videos with Marissa on our fancy
  new dining room computer.  The playlist included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h3hJJbdJQA">Anthony Fantano&#8217;s
  review of the new Bon Iver album</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jvy7eXMxE9Y">special Editor Edition
  Dude Perfect</a>, which honestly was so entertaining it left us
  speechless.  Marissa and I used to watch Dude Perfect sort of
  ironically, but now the irony is lost and we just actually enjoy them,
  despite the fact that it&#8217;s pretty much targeted at 12 year old boys.</p>
<p>I see today as the final hurdle before getting to the weekend.  I&#8217;m
  running a bit behind in ticket duty, so I&#8217;ll have to block off some
  time and catch up on support tickets &amp; questions.  I try not to
  finish the week with any loose threads.  Tomorrow is our end of the
  week demo, retro, and company picnic, leaving today as pretty much the
  last day to get any real work done.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s hit it hard today.  Let&#8217;s squeeze as many work hours out of
  this uncharacteristically chilly Thursday as we can.  A thorough
  Thursday makes for a fun Friday - alliteration intended.  Hope you
  have a great day today.</p>
