<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  It&#8217;s a beautiful day today.  If you&#8217;re not
  lucky to be off work today, then I at least hope everyone is being
  nice to you today.  This morning we had another late start to the
  day.  I cooked breakfast then bothered Marissa and Rodney until they
  reluctantly rolled out of bed to join me at the table.  We finally
  brought home our replacement coffee maker, and I think having hot drip
  coffee back in the morning is having an energizing effect on me.
  Don&#8217;t get me wrong - Moka is good stuff.  But sleepily calling ahead
  for a brew box and driving across East wash in my bathrobe is a weird
  start to the day, so I&#8217;m happy to put that behind me.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re rocking the 12 cup Black and Dekker drip coffee
  machine.  Sleek, shiny black plastic, a programmable LED clock, and
  &#8220;steal a cup feature&#8221; all at an affordable 19.99.  And yes, I&#8217;m going
  to hand wash the carafe from now on.  These days I feel like we
  replace our coffee maker so often, it kind of feels the trope of
  Strongbad breaking his retro, outdated computers and replacing them
  with slightly less outdated computers.  If our last Hamilton Beach
  machine was the Lappy 486, that would mean we&#8217;re now on the <i>Compé</i>.
  I wasn&#8217;t sure just then which computer came after the Lappy, but one
  of the reasons I love the homstar runner fan base is that everything
  about the website is carefully documented in a wiki, which I consulted
  to make sure that analogy landed accurately.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;ve got turkey at the top of mind.  Marissa and I
  formed a game plan at the breakfast table this morning.  Later today,
  I&#8217;m going to cook up a double batch of brine and keep it in one of our
  5 gallon buckets.  Tomorrow morning, we&#8217;re going to put a frozen
  turkey in the other and pad it with ice, and we&#8217;re going to use our
  cooler to transport the other.  We&#8217;re going to try to do most of our
  shopping on Wednesday afternoon, but today I&#8217;m going to pick up some
  gluten free buckwheat flour.  I have no doubt they&#8217;ll have it an our
  faithful Jenny Street Market, but just in case it&#8217;s not, there are
  plenty of other specialty food shops I can check.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty great day.  In the morning, I made a long list
  of things to get done, and I sort of chipped away at it all day.  Just
  before lunch, my dad stopped by to take me out for a beer, but we
  ended up just hanging around the house and eating some leftovers.  We
  sat at the dining room table.  I had a beer in my left hand and a cup
  of coffee in my right.  It was that weird time of day where that was
  somehow OK.  We chatted and grazed on leftovers until about 1, when
  Marissa suddenly remembered we had a doctor&#8217;s appointment.  In a cold
  sweat, she checked the calendar and breathed a sigh of relief seeing
  the appointment wasn&#8217;t until 1:30, and it was right across the street
  at the new clinic.  It was so perfect, it was almost like we planned
  it that way.  We sent my dad on his way and made our way across the
  street for Marissa&#8217;s routine checkup.  After checking baby&#8217;s
  heartbeats and getting a quick, expert blood draw, we made our way
  back home.</p>
<p>In the evening, we ran some errands at Target, picking up a new coffee
  maker and grabbing a some sweet potatoes and buns for dinner.  Picking
  up groceries at Target is risky business.  If you&#8217;re not careful, you
  could wind up spending $7 on asparagus or something, which almost
  happened.  Target is a crafty business.  Something tells me that the
  secret to their success is their ability to hike up the price
  exclusively on the things you didn&#8217;t realize you need.  We find
  ourselves heading to Target because they have cheap prices on
  vitamins, paper towels, and Tupperware, but the <i>oh, while we&#8217;re here
  we might as well get</i> mind-set is dangerous.  Beneath the surface
  appearance of affordability and convenience lie $4 butter, $7
  asparagus, and $5 cheese slices waiting to bamboozle poor,
  unsuspecting yuppies.</p>
<p>We made our way home.  I started preparing dinner as Marissa
  straightened up the house.  Having passed on the $7 plastic wrapped
  asparagus, I had to work with a single can of green beans left over
  from Ollie&#8217;s summer diet.  But after some lemon, butter, a diced
  shallot, and some dried mint, they didn&#8217;t taste half bad.  We finished
  off the plate with some leftover turkey smashed on Hawaiian buns,
  spread with some hot mustard and mashes sweet potatoes.  Oh, and there
  was some sliced swiss on there too.  It turns out we had to get those
  from Target after all.</p>
<p>After dinner, we put Rodney to bed and after a quick nap on the couch
  with Ziggy, I got back to my to-do list.  I caught up on some emails,
  one of which was with a friend from college.  We&#8217;re discussing the
  latest Kanye album, and the conversation with him bleed over into a
  conversation with my wife while we were milling around the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;So if we&#8217;re still entertaining the idea that Kanye is a secret genius
  and <i>everything</i> he does is intentional,&#8221; I explained, &#8220;then just
  maybe the album roll out was intentionally patterned after the
  ministry of Jesus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marissa pursed her lips and shook her head. &#8220;Wait wait wait,&#8221; I
  protested, trying to hold her attention.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying this isn&#8217;t
  blasphemous, but this is Kanye West we&#8217;re talking about.  I&#8217;m just
  saying - the mysterious listening parties created these droves of
  internet commenters <i>spreading</i> the good news?&#8221;  Marissa continued
  listening, narrowing her eyes to make it clear I didn&#8217;t have her yet.
  &#8220;And then he delayed the album indefinitely!&#8221;  I continued
  passionately.  &#8220;No new due date either!  Almost as if&#8230; <i>it died</i>.&#8221;
  Marissa started shaking her head again, this time wandering away.
  Hearing it aloud, I realized this wasn&#8217;t my strongest theory - even
  compared to how terrible these Kanye conspiracy theories usually are.
  Back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  After lunch, Marissa is going to take
  Rodney to agility practice, which will give me a nice change window to
  take down the home network and rewrite my server shelf.  After that, I
  have another long list of things to do, and I had better get started.
  Hope you all have a wonderful day, and a happy Thanksgiving&#8217;s Eve&#8217;s
  Eve.</p>
