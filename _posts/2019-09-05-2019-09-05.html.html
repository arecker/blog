<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Yesterday was a very busy day.  After work I
  took Rod to Hy-Vee to pick up some sides.  I had a chuck roast that
  had been dry aging in the fridge since Sunday, and I wanted to pick up
  some sides.  Rod brought along his giant giraffe to Hy-Vee too, but
  even with the extra member in our party we were in-and-out pretty
  quickly.  Rod and I have a pretty good Hy-Vee system at this point,
  and very few things can throw it off.</p>
<p>Speaking of getting thrown off, just as I was loading the groceries
  into the car, some dudes pulled up next to us and handing me a
  mixtape.  I gave the guy three bucks - partly because I like to
  support local artists, but also because he said I looked groovy and I
  was very flattered.  Rod, Giraffe, and I listened to the mixtape on
  the way home.  We only made it about ten minutes, but I think that&#8217;s
  all we needed.  And even if we had liked the mixtape, I don&#8217;t know how
  I would have tracked down the band because it doesn&#8217;t have anything
  written on it.  So I suppose I would have to comb through the tracks
  and just listen to the &#8220;shoutouts&#8221; or whatever.  Let that be a lesson,
  I guess.  If you&#8217;re at the stage in your rap career where you need to
  boost concert attendance by handing out mixtapes in the Hy-Vee parking
  lot, then you&#8217;re probably also at the point in your rap career where
  you need to write your name on them.</p>
<p>After we got home, Rod helped me cut up a shallot, but then lost
  interest and decided to go watch TV.  I really couldn&#8217;t blame him, I
  didn&#8217;t have any idea what I was doing with the giant piece of meat in
  the fridge, and he must have felt the vibes.  Even though it was
  really meant to be braised or cooked like a pot roast, I didn&#8217;t have
  time to do any of that, so I opted to just cook it like a giant steak
  with a reverse sear.  The three pound chuck roast took about 45
  minutes to get up to medium, and afterwards I seared the hell out of
  it on cast iron and basted it in butter.  I still had some rosemary
  and garlic around, so I put them to work.  I let the steak rest while
  I threw together some peas and carrots.  I thought I was in the clear
  and had pulled it off, until I cut into the steak.  The good news was
  that it was cooked perfectly - cooking a steak right is just a matter
  of reading a thermometer correctly.  But the meat was chewy, and there
  was an abundance of unappetizing fluid on the plate.  So the moral of
  the story is that while you can cook a chuck roast as if it were a
  giant steak, it won&#8217;t taste like one.  It was still perfectly edible,
  and my hungry family graciously just filled up on end pieces, bread,
  and sides, but just something to remember for later.  While cleaning
  up, I joked with Marissa that after proving I can turn an
  inappropriate piece of meat into a barely passable steak, cooking a
  real steak next time should feel pretty easy.  Kind of like how
  baseball players practice with weights at the end of their bad - so
  when the weight comes off and they step up to the plate, the bat feels
  lighter.  In the same vain, I should see if I can reverse sear a shoe.</p>
<p>After putting Rod to bed, Marissa painted and I kept the cooking party
  rolling into the evening, making more batches of palmiers in between
  Wednesday chores.  The first batch of palmiers turned out terrible -
  the hearts unfolded into what looked like angry crab pincers, and they
  burned, but I found a good system and the batches started to
  normalize.  Soon I had the hearts in-tact, golden brown, ready to be
  paraded around the office.</p>
<p>Baking is difficult.  It almost feels like a sport.  I&#8217;m pretty
  exhausted, and tonight I think I&#8217;m going to suggest we eat at
  Portillo&#8217;s to give our kitchen a break.</p>
<p>Marissa and I finished the night by sitting on the couch together and
  watching New Girl.  We&#8217;re both still reeling from our decision to stop
  watching <i>Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</i>.  I read somewhere yesterday that attention
  is our only currency, and we should spend it wisely.  Something to
  keep in mind as the &#8220;binge-able TV mini series&#8221; becomes more
  fashionable.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my time.  Hope you all have a wonderful day today.</p>
