excerpt: garlic, christmas lights, and dinner at the bar
---
<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Are you feeling good this morning?  I&#8217;m
  feeling good this morning.  Over the weekend, both Marissa and I had a
  scratchy throat that was threatening to turn into a soar throat.  But
  it either could have been just the exhaustion of traveling, eating
  fast food on the road, or maybe we really were about to get sick and
  we just caught it in time.  I heard somewhere that garlic can help
  boost the immune system, so last night I made sure to sneak in at
  least three fresh cloves into our dinner, and then just to make sure I
  made a small batch of <i>garlic confit</i>.  That&#8217;s basically just garlic
  simmered gently in olive oil, and it&#8217;s a great way to use up the rest
  of what you buy for dinner.  So this morning, there&#8217;s lots of garlic
  in my stomach, and I&#8217;m feeling good.  And even if that is just a
  placebo, how many other placebos enable you to eat as much garlic as
  you want?  That&#8217;s not so bad, is it?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kind of amazed that we&#8217;ve made it this far into the winter season
  without getting sick.  Normally we pick up at least one case of the
  sniffles heading into the holidays, but then again maybe it&#8217;s all the
  garlic we&#8217;re eating.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty great day.  I started the day off with a team
  meeting, then trotted up stairs to the Ki Gong session.  We spent the
  first ten minutes of class just swinging our arms, bouncing on our
  knees, and chit chatting about the holidays.  Often I&#8217;ve described Ki
  Gong to people as &#8220;that thing you see old people doing in the park,&#8221;
  but having attending plenty of classes this year, that&#8217;s now hitting
  me as an unfair summary.  Ki Gong feels like a little bit of yoga,
  meditation, and self-guided physical therapy.  And yes, sometimes we
  do the kind of moves you see old people doing in the park, but in an
  undeniably cool way.</p>
<p>After Ki Gong finished, I wandered into the work day.  I got a good
  jump on my tasks for this week and ended up finishing a lot more than
  I had planned for the day, so I teed up some more experimental work
  for the next day, and decided to catch up on some reading I had missed
  last week.  After the work day, I jumped on a bus and headed home.</p>
<p>As I walked up our driveway, Marissa was sitting on the front porch
  with the dogs tied up with their leashes.  She was holding a cup of
  coffee and smiling.  Without even making the mental connection that
  she had worked all day on the Christmas lights and could probably use
  some encouragement, I instead growled at her about a small extension
  cord routed across the side walk.  &#8220;That&#8217;s gonna trip somebody,&#8221; I
  snapped like a grumpy old man.  &#8220;Marissa meekly nodded, then after we
  walked inside, she confronted me about not noticing the brilliant
  Christmas lights in the front yard.  I felt horrible, so before
  leaving for the grocery store we wandered back out to the front yard
  for a gander.</p>
<p>We picked up dinner at Jenny Street then returned home.  As I cooked
  in the kitchen, Marissa tidied up the living room.  All evening, we
  couldn&#8217;t help but remark at how much extra time we had with Rodney
  staying at my parents&#8217; place.  &#8220;Earlier today, I thought I would have
  to take a break because I wouldn&#8217;t get through it all, but I looked at
  the clock and it was only three o&#8217;clock!&#8221; Marissa recounted.  I felt
  the same kind of relief - dinner came together pretty quickly, and
  within about an hour I had a casserole dish packed with two warm bowls
  of stammpot, gravy, sausages, a dish of applesauce, and a warm
  sourdough loaf.  We walked out dinner over to the malthouse and found
  a table in the back.  Becky the bartender walked over and lit the
  candle on the table.  &#8220;This should complete your candle light dinner,&#8221;
  she laughed.  Peeling back the foil on our stammpot, the smell started
  to leech into the rest of the bar.  &#8220;I feel like kind of an asshole,
  but I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; I laughed.  &#8220;Yeah people order pizza in here all
  the time, I don&#8217;t see how that&#8217;s any different,&#8221; Marissa added.</p>
<p>As we ate, we emptied our backlog of snapchats we got from my mom and
  dad.  We watched Rodney eat dinner, go shopping, and kick around a
  soccer ball in his pajamas.  As we were finishing, a local band
  started to set up in the corner.  We were almost done with our drinks,
  so we decided to only stay for two songs.  &#8220;Our neighborhood has a lot
  of good folk bands,&#8221; I said as we left the bar.  &#8220;But do you ever get
  the feeling that all these bands are made up of the same four or five
  dudes?&#8221;</p>
<p>When we got home, Marissa and I spent most of the evening cleaning up
  the house.  Later in the evening, Marissa beckoned me upstairs to
  Rodney&#8217;s room, which she had just finished vacuuming.  It looked so
  cozy.</p>
<p>I finished the night on the couch watching YouTube videos while
  Marissa decorated the tree.  I had lots of Bears news to catch up on.
  Yesterday, the Bears announced that Akiem Hicks was at practice, which
  bodes well for our game against the Cowboys.  Even though our playoff
  chances are slim, at least I&#8217;ll get to see Hicks and Mack play
  together at the game on Thursday, which will be a treat in itself.</p>
<p>Today should be a good day too - more of the same.  Getting lots of
  work done, vicariously enjoying Rodney&#8217;s week through snapchat, and
  later we&#8217;re going to go out to eat with some friends.  Marissa decided
  that on Wednesday, we&#8217;re going to sit down and plan out the whole
  weekend.  &#8220;I kind of just want to stare at a map and study all the
  places we&#8217;ll be this weekend,&#8221; I said.  Marissa nodded.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  Hope you have a wonderful Tuesday today.
  Eat garlic, swing your arms, and bring a home cooked meal to the bar.</p>
