<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  I think we definitely made the most
  of the long weekend.  We ate breakfast on the back porch, ran some
  errands, and worked outside.  I finally got around to cleaning the
  grill.  After putting Rod to bed, I decided to try baking another
  batch of palmiers.  I was very meticulous this time about rolling the
  puff pastry thinly onto parchment paper and thoroughly covering them
  with sugar.  But when it came time to form the hearts, it became very
  clear that the dimensions were way off.  The cookies are supposed to
  bake with these gentle folded-over layers (about three of them).  But
  I started with a piece of pastry that was way too big, which made a
  cookie that had several very small folds, and by the time they were
  done they looked like little baskets of worms, or a diagram of small
  intestines.</p>
<p>Puff pastry can be so cruel.  I&#8217;m slowly learning that things that
  look pretty going into the oven don&#8217;t always look pretty coming out
  after they&#8217;re baked.  I guess beginner&#8217;s luck was at play here - since
  my first try at these cookies turned out great, I thought I was
  invincible - before I pulled the twisted mayhem out of the oven last
  night.</p>
<p>As a joke, I took all the terrible burnt off cuts and put them in nice
  pastry dish underneath a towel; then I asked Marissa to take a picture
  of them for Instagram.  I got a good, cheap laugh out of her when she
  removed the towel with her camera ready.  I was planning on saving
  face and acting like I was proud of them, but I broke character and we
  had a good laugh.</p>
<p>Once I was done burning sugar in the kitchen, we made our way to the
  living room to watch some TV.  As of last night, we&#8217;re marching on
  with <i>Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</i>.  After finishing three episodes, just before
  heading up to bed Marissa broke the morose silence and asked, &#8220;Can we
  stop watching this?&#8221;  &#8220;Yeah I&#8217;m so sick of this show,&#8221; I laughed.
  There&#8217;s nothing like the instant relief of deciding not to watch a
  show any more.  How liberating!  So probably as of tonight, we&#8217;re
  going back to re-watching New Girl.  Sorry, <i>Handmaid&#8217;s Tale</i>.  You
  had your moments, but you just weren&#8217;t good enough for how sad you
  are.  And I&#8217;m tired of having weird dreams about kidnapping and
  fascism.  I think it&#8217;s also making me stress eat.  To cope with last
  night&#8217;s episode binge, I stress ate almost the whole bowl of joke
  palmiers I set aside.  And this morning it feels like a group of
  radical fundamentalists established a fascist theocracy inside my
  stomach.</p>
<p>It feels good to drink coffee.  Marissa and I finally bought a blade
  grinder, and now we&#8217;re enjoying the freshly ground stuff.  We were
  saving up for a nice burr grinder, and at some point we must have just
  given up on it and continued to buy pre-ground beans.  Then one day
  the thought crossed my head that we could probably get a really good
  blade grinder for a fraction of the money we&#8217;d spend on an average
  burr grinder.  So we pulled the trigger, and now there&#8217;s no looking
  back.  It&#8217;s a wonderful little blade grinder.  It supports different
  settings, but what really takes the cake is that it that you don&#8217;t
  have to sit there and hold the button - it will finish the grind for
  you.  And it doesn&#8217;t look like an eye soar either.  It&#8217;s small and
  sleek, like a little robot in the corner.</p>
<p>This week will be all about planning the high school reunion, which is
  happening this Saturday.  It&#8217;s weird planning it all through email -
  it&#8217;s hard to tell if I&#8217;m not doing enough or doing too much.  So I&#8217;m
  just trying to make sure we have the basics - a place, a time, some
  people, and food.  Oh, and beer.  That probably completes the &#8220;stand
  around awkwardly&#8221; survival kit.  But that&#8217;s a worst case scenario, I
  think it&#8217;s going to go great and we&#8217;re going to have a wonderful time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my time.  I hope you all have a wonderful Tuesday.  As a
  closing thought, if you too are stuck watching a TV show that&#8217;s just
  not quite good enough to warrant feeling sad all the time, don&#8217;t be
  afraid to break things off.  Just unapologetically say &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
  to watch this!&#8221; And then watch New Girl instead.</p>
