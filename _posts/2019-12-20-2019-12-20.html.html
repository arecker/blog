<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope this entry finds you well.  It&#8217;s chilly
  this morning, but the weather nerds promise it may warm up a bit
  today.  Last night before going to bed, Marissa and I were kicking
  around the idea of checking out the Zoo, which is currently decked out
  with Christmas lights.  It certainly sounds like a great way to
  celebrate - <i>drum roll please</i> - the end of Christmas gauntlet week.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  In the morning, I hung around the
  house with Rodney.  We ate some breakfast, which consisted of some
  mini Dutch apple cereal bars.  I put about seven of them on Rodney&#8217;s
  plate, planning to eat half of them, but Rodney practically knocked my
  hand away.  &#8220;Dada NO,&#8221; he scolded me.  &#8220;Rodney&#8217;s - not dada&#8217;s.&#8221;  I
  reluctantly grabbed three more out of the box and put them on a napkin
  beside me.  You gotta pick your battles, right?</p>
<p>After breakfast, Marissa left for dog class, and Rodney and I
  eventually moved upstairs.  I worked at my desk while Rodney screwed
  around with things in my technology bin.  The way Rodney sees my tech
  min, echoing the words of my boss, &#8220;it&#8217;s just a really expensive box
  of LEGOs.&#8221;  Rodney spent the morning fiddling with an Ethernet crimper
  and trying to stick SD cards in a DVD burner.  Rodney, of course, took
  the work seriously.  &#8220;No Blippi - Rodney work.&#8221;</p>
<p>We both took a break for some lunch, heating up some frozen corn dogs
  and leftover hutspot.  Marissa returned home just as we were sitting
  down to eat.  After a quick lunch, we all took a drive to my office
  and dropped off some cookies.  Marissa chatted with my team while
  Rodney and I played with a whiteboard wheeled against the wall.  My
  teammate Alex joined us and demonstrated some of his improvisational
  sketching skills.  Taking orders from Rodney, he drew shapes,
  airplanes and even an imaginary take on a &#8220;Jesus plane&#8221;, which may or
  may not have been what Rodney was actually trying to say, but
  entertaining nonetheless.</p>
<p>I bid my family farewell, and worked the rest of the afternoon.  Being
  on ticket duty this week, I picked up a low priority edge case that
  sounded pretty amusing.  We had a script that was occasionally timing
  out when our VMs launch in Amazon, so wearing my UNIX hat, I wrote a
  cute little function wrapper around it.  I borrowed a machine in our
  staging environment to test my new code, and to my delight, it worked
  on the first try.</p>
<p>I rewarded my efforts by treating myself to a White Claw in our
  Thursday happy hour.  I sat upstairs chatting with my team before
  finally heading outside and jumping on the bus homeward.</p>
<p>We had big plans for Thursday evening, so immediately after arriving
  home we all jumped in the car and headed towards the mall.  Rodney was
  already muttering to himself about seeing Santa and asking him for
  tools.  When we got to the mall, we claimed a spot in line.  Rodney
  amused himself by talking to a kid waiting behind us, who was playing
  Pokemon Go on his dad&#8217;s phone and kindly offered to get Rodney
  involved.  Rodney returned the favor by letting him play with a tiny
  motorcycle that he keeps in his pocket these days.</p>
<p>I was proud of how friendly and considerate Rodney was playing with a
  complete stranger he met in line, and doubly surprise that the other
  boy returned the favor.  Two three year old boys meeting for the first
  time and having absolutely no issue sharing their toys - at the mall
  of all places - seems like a miracle or something.</p>
<p>It was finally our turn to see Santa, and as we approached the chair
  (Santa&#8217;s throne?), Rodney&#8217;s shyness started to kick in.  He stood
  about three feet away and muttered the request he had been rehearsing
  in the car.  Santa patiently smiled and offered him a paper ornament.
  &#8220;This is much further than we got last year,&#8221; Marissa explained.  It&#8217;s
  true - last year, we stood in line, then Rodney refused to approach
  Santa, so the fact that he even spoke to him was a big deal for us.
  Maybe by this time next year, he&#8217;ll be ready to give Santa a high
  five.</p>
<p>We ordered some Chinese food in the food court, and as Rodney picked
  at a crab Rangoon, Marissa and I chatted.  I had found time earlier in
  the day to read more of my <i>Difficult Conversations</i> book, and it was
  on my mind, so I shared.  Without going into too much detail, Marissa
  and I had some neighbor trouble earlier in the year.  The
  confrontation certainly left a deep scratch on 2019 for us, and we
  used the rest of our time shopping to analyze it, strolling around in
  the mall and letting Rodney burn some energy in the kids play area.</p>
<p>As dorky as it sounds, we tried to look at the conflict through the
  lens of the book.  And several months later, we were both still
  feeling sad, anxious, and confused about the whole thing, and having a
  difficult time letting go of the painful experience.  We were willing
  to try anything at that point.  We walked through the timeline of the
  fight, this time paying attention to our own contributions to
  situation, avoiding guessing at their intentions, negotiating with our
  strong emotions, and trying to assemble a more complete story.  And it
  helped, too.  Using each other as a sound board, we made some real
  progress, and this morning personally I&#8217;m feeling much less angry
  about it.  We finished off the night of shopping with a quick Target
  stop.  I distracted Rodney while Marissa bought his stocking stuffers,
  all the while enjoying the afterglow of a small, tandem psychological
  breakthrough.  &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we talked about it,&#8221; Marissa said.  &#8220;I feel
  good.&#8221;  I think that&#8217;s evidence that some healing took place last
  night in the mall, and I felt it too.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  I went a little long today, and I
  probably missed my bus, but I&#8217;m going to try anyway.  Thanks for
  reading, and hope you have a wonderful Friday.  Here&#8217;s to the end of
  holiday gauntlet week!</p>
