<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  I got a lot done yesterday.  The morning was
  filled with meetings, then we went out to lunch with the interns.  I
  had a hot bowl of ramen, which put me in a good mood for the rest of
  the day.  I bounced around different rooms to do some writing, taking
  a break at 2 PM for a Ki Gong session.  When I got to the fitness
  room, there was a little sign on the door noting that class would be
  held on the capital lawn.  When I got there, it was just the
  instructor Justin, but I stayed to do some Ki Gong with him and it was
  really relaxing.  It was a lot easier to focus on my breathing outside
  feeling the grass on my feet.  There were a lot of bugs in the lawn,
  and occasionally a fly or a few ants would wander of my ankles,
  testing my concentration.</p>
<p>After the session, we chatted about Ki Gong for a bit.  I shared with
  him that I think it might be helping with my anger.  The anger was
  caused by other things, but it&#8217;s always worsened with stress, and I
  have a much less stressful day whenever I make time for Ki Gong at
  work.  The slow breathing and smooth movements usually take my mind
  out of whatever I was working on and give me a chance to reset my
  brain.  It feels good to not think about anything, and just practice
  breathing.</p>
<p>After Ki Gong, I wrapped up the blog post and met back with the
  interns for a quick sync up.  I got to see some of their slides, as
  well as the video showing off their new easy button.  I was pretty
  blown away, I think it&#8217;s going to be a really big deal at the
  company.  And honestly I feel like I spent most of the time just
  watching them work from the sidelines.  As our time together this
  summer is coming to a close, I spent a lot of time yesterday
  reflecting on how cool it&#8217;s been to work alongside them.</p>
<p>After work, I took Rodney to Hy-Vee to pick up a few things to make
  Carbonara.  Before leaving, while I was changing him, Rod got all
  excited about busses, and I thought he was talking about them in the
  abstract, so I joined in.  &#8220;Yeah, dude, the bus?  Sweet, busses ARE
  sweet, you got that right.&#8221;  But after he put his backpack on and
  wandered to the end of the driveway, it became clear to me that he
  thought we were going to take the bus somewhere instead of our usual
  Hy-Vee car ride.  I was pretty crushed, and what made it worse was
  that he was pretty mature about the miscommunication.  He just let out
  a quick whimper, then climbed into his car seat and asked to listen to
  his favorite album.</p>
<p>So whatever we&#8217;re doing this weekend, you can be sure it will be
  involved taking the bus somewhere.  We&#8217;re thinking about taking the
  bus downtown on Saturday to go to the Farmer&#8217;s market.</p>
<p>The Carbonara turned out great.  Rod wanted to help, so I put him on
  basil-ripping duty, but he kept wandering away from his workstation
  and eating cheese off the cutting board.</p>
<p>Marissa put Rod to bed while I played chess on our dining room
  computer.  I hadn&#8217;t checked in on my chess skills in a while, and I&#8217;m
  sad to report that the computer absolutely kicked my butt.  I guess I
  don&#8217;t have the best strategy.  I don&#8217;t know much about chess strategy,
  but I&#8217;m guessing there is <i>never</i> a time where you are allowed to just
  move a piece and say &#8220;eh, let&#8217;s see what happens now&#8221;.  You know how
  the measure of a good chess player is how many moves ahead they are,
  mentally?  I think when I play, I&#8217;m -1 moves, meaning I don&#8217;t even
  understand the last move I made.</p>
<p>After giving up on chess for the night, I did some chores.  On
  Wednesdays, I clean the microwave, the stove, and the fridge.  Marissa
  had a new water heater installed, and she discovered that you can set
  how hot the water gets.  As a result of tweaking the setting, the
  water in the kitchen sink was hotter, and it was way easier to get
  grime off of the stove.</p>
<p>After chores, I tidied up my upstairs computer.  It was long overdue,
  I still had parts strewn about after stripping down the file server,
  and to pass the time I reinstalled my OS.  I was running out of disk
  space, and now that we have a dining room computer, I don&#8217;t have any
  use for games and kids stuff upstairs, so I did without all of that
  and just set up the basics needed for journaling, notes, and email.</p>
<p>Today should be a good day.  On Thursdays, we take a break from
  cooking and eat out while running errands - it&#8217;s usually Portillo&#8217;s. I
  think I&#8217;m getting fitted for a suit, so definitely looking forward to
  having someone wrap a tape measure around my legs and waist after a
  heavy, greasy Portillo&#8217;s dinner.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful Thursday today.  Go out somewhere for
  dinner today - you earned it.</p>
