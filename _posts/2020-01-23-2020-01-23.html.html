<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.  Happy Thursday.  It has been an absolute
  whirlwind of a work week, and right now I&#8217;m just grateful to be
  feeling good, wearing clean clothes, starting a journal entry right on
  time.</p>
<p>In short, yesterday was pretty brutal.  Questions seemed to fly at me
  from all different directions for the duration of the day.  Working
  from home upstairs, I was so distracted, I almost forgot to come
  downstairs to help Rodney pull his pants back up after he used the
  potty in the living room.  He has no problem pulling them down, but
  when it comes time to pull them back up, he needs help getting the
  waistband of the <i>ondergoed en broek</i> lined up, and as a result the
  poor guy was just patiently watching TV with his pants down, waiting
  for me to come help him.  I worked the rest of the morning from the
  living room couch, just so I&#8217;d be more in tune with underwear related
  needs until Marissa got home.</p>
<p>By the time she returned at 11:30, my head was already swimming, and
  nothing sounded sweeter than shutting my laptop for a beer and a slice
  of pizza.  Shortly after, we packed the dogs away, tired from agility
  and undoubtedly grateful for a nap, then we jumped in the car and
  headed to Ian&#8217;s.  We found our usual table in the back.  I sat there
  quietly, watching Rodney gingerly take bits from a slice of pepperoni
  pizza that was larger than his plastic plate.  Wednesday pizza lunch
  clears my head.  Having finished our pizza, Rodney got up to grab a
  bag of free-to-use toys off the wall, and I got a second beer.
  Marissa and I just sleepily stared at each other, smirking whenever
  the table full of high schoolers beside us said something loud enough
  for us to hear.  They were talking about an upcoming prom, and just in
  case you all were wondering, the dress code isn&#8217;t like an official
  thing.  You can go with a theme, or just do something totally chill
  like all black with a tie.</p>
<p>Finishing up our lunch, I was looking forward to putting in an honest
  afternoon of work before once again shutting my laptop.  I was already
  day dreaming about shopping at Hy-Vee and making something new for
  dinner.</p>
<p>Around five o&#8217;clock, I got pulled into a work incident.  This wasn&#8217;t a
  public incident, so sadly, I can&#8217;t share the details, but the
  important part was that it required me to work later than I had
  planned.  With Rodney and Marissa napping, I sat in my bedroom busily
  scripting and talking on slack, watching the hours tick away.
  &#8220;There&#8217;s five o&#8217;clock&#8221; I thought.  &#8220;Normally I&#8217;d be at Hy-Vee&#8221;.  More
  work.  &#8220;There&#8217;s six o&#8217;clock&#8221;, I thought.  &#8220;I&#8217;d be getting home and
  starting on dinner right now.</p>
<p>I shot Marissa a text message, asking her to get Rodney up and meet me
  in the bedroom for a family meeting.  Moments later, a very sleepy and
  confused Rodney and Marissa wandered into the bedroom.  Marissa
  surprised to see me still working, sat down on the bed.</p>
<p>I explained to them that I had to work late, and though I would
  probably wrap it up just in time for dinner, we&#8217;d have to figure
  something out to do instead.  Marissa ordered Portillo&#8217;s.  The whole
  thing probably didn&#8217;t warrant a <i>family meeting</i>, but it doesn&#8217;t take
  much to rattle me, and I felt the need to get everybody in the room to
  come up with a new plan for the evening.</p>
<p>We finally called the all clear at 7.  &#8220;Just in time for dinner,&#8221; I
  thought.  The evening was already steering back on the rails.  I
  joined Marissa and Rodney at the dinner table, ate a hot dog in four
  bites, then nibbled on fries while we chatted.</p>
<p>Marissa agreed to put Rodney to bed so I could catch up on chores.  I
  hadn&#8217;t used the kitchen all day, so all I had to do was clean the
  fridge, wipe out the microwave, and clean the stove.  By 9:00, Marissa
  and I were ready to head into the basement.  I laid on the bed,
  wearing my boots and apron, for an extra second, then after a big
  stretch and yawn, stood up and trudged down the stairs.</p>
<p>Our cleaning session had a rocky start.  Immediately Marissa noticed
  dirty bater bubbling up through the basement drain.  We stood there
  confused for a moment before Marissa sent me upstairs to fetch the
  drain snake and plunger.  Doing our best not to think about the smell,
  I stood by while Marissa rolled up her sleeves and coaxed the water
  back down the drain.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I googled it,&#8221; I said, breaking the silence.  &#8220;It says this can
  sometimes happen after a lot of rain - the city sewer system can get
  backed up I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marissa peered up at me, holding her black and grey stained hands away
  from her.  &#8220;We probably had a lot of snow melt.  It was a warm day,&#8221;
  she replied.</p>
<p>Despite the rocky start, we found our momentum again and resumed
  gutting the back corner of the basement.  We went through clothes, old
  house decorations, and baby toys.  For each time we were on the fence
  about keeping or donating something, I&#8217;d repeat the phrase &#8220;It&#8217;s more
  expensive to keep it then to get rid of it.&#8221;  Marissa nodded each
  time, as if I were making a good point, but trudging up and down the
  basement stairs, making trips to the shed and trunk of the car, I had
  plenty of time to come to the realization that I was full of shit and
  that phrase didn&#8217;t make any sense.  <i>It&#8217;s more expensive to keep it
  than to get rid of it.</i> It certainly sounds nice, doesn&#8217;t it?  But
  it&#8217;s definitely bullshit.  Sometimes my ability to formulate bullshit
  so naturally worries me.</p>
<p>We worked until 10:30 at night.  As we were walking around the
  basement, the dogs joined us, as if they wanted to also bask in the
  new clean basement corner.  We all went upstairs to hang on the couch
  for the remainder of the night.</p>
<p>This morning, I&#8217;m feeling tired, but grateful I&#8217;m here where I&#8217;m
  supposed to be.  I&#8217;m still feeling good, wearing a clean set of
  clothes, and with my boss&#8217;s blessing, I&#8217;m going to cut early today in
  lieu of comp time for working late last night.  I&#8217;ll use the time to
  shut my eyes on the couch, pick up some groceries, and cook a healthy
  meal before heading into Kids Code tonight.  And after it all, we have
  Thursday night.  Thursday night is glorious, isn&#8217;t it?  On Thursday,
  the only thing standing between you and the weekend is a measly
  Friday, and as we all know, Fridays are basically weekends in work
  clothes.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.  Thanks for reading.</p>
