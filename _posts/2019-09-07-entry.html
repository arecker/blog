<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  I got an early start today.  It&#8217;s the day of
  our high school reunion, and before we drive down to Arlington
  Heights, I&#8217;m making breakfast, then pre-cooking two dozen brats.
  Aside from the food, the car is pretty much all packed.</p>
<p>This morning, I had to bust out the old french press to make coffee.
  Our trusty Hamilton Beach carafe emerged from the dishwasher with a
  crack in it.  Don&#8217;t worry, everyone.  Starbucks trained me for
  emergencies like these.  One liter of hot water, 56 grams of coarsely
  ground beans, four and a half minutes, then gently plunge and
  immediately remove the coffee.  I used to make coffee like this every
  morning in college, and it worked well, but the second you need to
  support one other person&#8217;s morning coffee habits, suddenly the once
  charming, tiny two cup form factor of the french press loses its
  appeal.</p>
<p>Last night I looked on amazon for a replacement carafe.  The machine
  still worked great, in fact I just ran cleaning solution through it
  the other day.  But I couldn&#8217;t find a replacement for the cracked
  carafe, and as silly as it sounds I just bought a whole new machine
  for twenty dollars.  Just replace the whole damn thing - that&#8217;s how we
  Americans fix things I suppose.</p>
<p>So what else is going on&#8230; today is pretty much all about the high
  school reunion.  It&#8217;s the culmination of a few months of part time
  planning.  I&#8217;m a little nervous - not because I&#8217;m seeing people from
  high school, but mostly because Lexi and I planned it all over email
  and that&#8217;s a tricky way to plan a party.  I think all things
  considered, we did a good job, and if we missed anything, we&#8217;ll just
  have to improvise.</p>
<p>The whole thing was very reminiscent of planning events in high school
  student council.  It&#8217;s funny how those feelings come rushing back,
  only this time instead of handwritten posters and morning
  announcements, it&#8217;s email, facebook, and google sheets.</p>
<p>Last night, to prevent myself from driving Marissa crazy with party
  planning nerves, I baked another batch of palmiers.  I&#8217;m proud to say
  that we&#8217;re well past asking &#8220;did they turn out?&#8221;  Now, it&#8217;s all about
  systematizing the recipe, fine tuning the hardware choices, making
  more cookies with less of a mess.  I figured out that if you use a
  pair of chopsticks, you can turn the cookies on the pan more quickly.
  I also switched to parchment paper so I wouldn&#8217;t need to re use the
  same silpat (which after three batches would accumulate burnt sugar,
  but no such problem with disposable parchment paper).  Lastly, I
  discovered that if you give the raw cookies a firm squeeze before
  setting them on a tray, the hearts form better.</p>
<p>On the work front, Friday was a pretty good day.  Josh, Fong, Jane and
  I went out to lunch at Morris Ramen.  As it was chilly and cloudy all
  day, we were proud of our choice to eat hot soup, it was a nice boost
  of calm energy in the middle of the day.  Afterwards, my team met to
  discuss goals for the upcoming months.  We always have interesting
  discussions when we undertake sorting long term priorities.  You gain
  a lot of insight just listening to people&#8217;s take on things.</p>
<p>After work, Rod and I made a pizza.  We ate it outside on the back
  porch.  The nights are cool, and I think just about all the nasty
  summer bugs are gone for the winter.</p>
<p>I had better get going with these brats.  Hope you all have a
  wonderful day, and to the class of 2009, I&#8217;ll see all you fine people
  at the reunion.</p>
