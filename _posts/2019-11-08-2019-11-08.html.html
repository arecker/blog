excerpt: serverless, home goods, and relaxing

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  I have good news for you.  Today is Friday.
  We made it through each of these cold early November weekdays, and
  eight measly hours from now, we&#8217;ll all be done for the weekend.  And
  I&#8217;d just like to take a moment in this journal entry to congratulate
  you.  <a href="https://youtu.be/3Yd3lQVbkYc">Hey - look at us.</a></p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty busy day.  All morning I worked on some code.
  I was playing around in AWS Step Functions.  For anyone curious about
  what the whole serverless development cycle is like, I think I can
  give you a good primer.  It&#8217;s a lot harder.  Of course writing a few
  scripts and sticking them on some server in the corner, stringing them
  together with cron jobs and system packages would be harder to
  maintain, but the trade-off is that things are a lot less magical.
  When writing things in Lambda, the long term maintenance cost of
  running code virtually disappears, but there&#8217;s definitely a hefty
  immediate investment in development time.  Lambdas are kind of hard to
  test.  After the lambda runs, you have to go clean-up everything it
  changed so you can fire it again - because it probably didn&#8217;t work the
  first 500 times.  And you could try to automate the clean-up - maybe
  even with other lambdas, but then you have to test those.  And sure,
  it&#8217;s all still just regular code and you could totally run it locally,
  but you also spend a lot of time crafting your state machine config,
  which you can only test by firing the state machine on amazon, which
  also fires your lambdas, and don&#8217;t forget you have to go clean those
  up every time they run.</p>
<p>But sometime around lunch time, I fired the Step function for the
  501th time, and it worked, so in celebration, I retreated to the
  kitchen to heat up some hutspot.  I also heated up some an extra bowl
  of hutspot for my team to try, which may have been a questionable
  decision.  Biting into mine, the kale was a little gritty, and while
  it didn&#8217;t really affect the taste, having a few grains of sand
  bouncing between your tongue and your teeth while you chew is
  unsettling.  Here&#8217;s a free tip, always try food before you offer it to
  other people.</p>
<p>After lunch, we rolled out another change to production, which went
  smoothly.  This is the sixth region we&#8217;ve migrated, and by now they&#8217;re
  getting very routine - so much so that we spend the hour chit chatting
  about places to eat, weekend plans, and funny stories from previous
  jobs.  Of course, there&#8217;s still the possibility things could go wrong,
  so all the while we&#8217;re all scrutinizing dashboards and metrics that
  pour in from all over our infrastructure.  Sheer boredom punctuated by
  moments of sheer terror.</p>
<p>At about 4:15, I joined some people for the downstairs happy hour, but
  seeing I only had about ten minutes before I had to catch my bus, I
  wisely just sipped on a La Croix as I chatted with my teammates.  At
  4:25, I stepped outside and onto the bus.  There&#8217;s few things in my
  week that feel as good as slumping into a bus seat, knowing I don&#8217;t
  have to move nor talk to anyone for twenty minutes.  Sometimes I even
  mutter to myself &#8220;no more jobs&#8230;&#8221;, which is something Marissa and I
  say to each other before going to bed.  It&#8217;s a joke from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MGCNil3lvQ">comedy
  special</a> we watched a long time ago.  &#8220;No more jobs&#8221; is something you
  proudly announce to yourself after you&#8217;ve crawled into bed and you are
  sure that there is no reason to get up until the morning.</p>
<p>After I got home, my entire family was wadded up on the couch in a
  single blanket.  I couldn&#8217;t even see Marissa underneath all the dogs,
  pillows, and toddler until she sheepishly craned her neck from behind
  Rodney&#8217;s head.  I joined them at the end of the couch, and we finished
  an episode of Blippi.</p>
<p>We left to go eat at Portillo&#8217;s.  Thursday has become our day to run
  errands and indulge in fast food.  Thursdays have also become my <i>lazy
  day</i>, since I don&#8217;t do any chores on Thursday and I don&#8217;t have to cook
  either.  We ate dinner at Portillo&#8217;s, then parked the car at Home
  Goods.</p>
<p>We walked into Home Goods looking for an office chair, a new garbage
  can, and I also needed some things for the kitchen, like a new non
  stick pan and one of those fancy little wooden containers to keep
  kosher salt on the table.  This was also the first time I remember
  going to Home Goods, and the experience was overwhelming, and a little
  repulsive.  As I wandered through the crowded, ill-conceived aisles of
  homemaking miscellany, I didn&#8217;t feel like was in a store.  I felt like
  I was wandering around in somebody&#8217;s garage, or maybe even a warehouse
  for evidence that the police no longer need.  A wall of knives.
  Christmas lights.  Wicker baskets.  Rugs.  A decorative santa doll
  even lept off the shelf and attacked my son.  At least the office
  chairs were easy to find.  They were practically spilling into the
  aisle.</p>
<p>I found my little salt container.  It wasn&#8217;t on a shelf with other
  salt containers; it was just sitting at the corner of a crowded shelf.
  Putting it in our cart, I felt like I was stealing a knick-knack off
  of somebody&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>We hit Target before we went home.  I was relieved to be back on
  earth.  Home Goods was an interesting experience, but I don&#8217;t think
  I&#8217;ll ever seek it out.  &#8220;You&#8217;re more of a Bed Bath and Beyond kind of
  person,&#8221; Marissa laughed.  &#8220;But some people really get into Home
  Goods, you can find good deals.&#8221;  I added, &#8220;it&#8217;s great if you enjoy
  rifling through garbage.&#8221;</p>
<p>After we got home, I crashed on the couch.  Ziggy joined me in my lap.
  Needless to say, nesting power hour did not happen last night.  After
  nodding off in the car on the way home from Target, I decided to
  truncate my Nesting Power Hour cleaning ambitions and limit it to just
  three days a week.  For the rest of the night, I watched youtube
  videos with Ziggy curled in my lap.  But each time she would drift off
  to sleep, her eyes would widen, remembering that I had a glass of
  eggnog on the table.</p>
<p>Happy Friday, everyone.  To any Home Goods loyalists out there, I hope
  I didn&#8217;t offend you.  You have a valuable skill.  When our
  civilization collapses, we&#8217;ll need people like you to rifle through
  all the abandoned, derelict buildings and find supplies.</p>
<p>Have a great day, a great weekend, and thanks for reading.  No more
  jobs!</p>
