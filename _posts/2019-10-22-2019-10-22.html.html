<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re doing wonderful this morning.
  Looks like it&#8217;s supposed to keep raining today.  Yesterday it happened
  to downpour for the four minutes it took me to cross the street and
  walk to the bus stop.  It always seems to work out that way, doesn&#8217;t
  it?  I also wore a lighter pair of canvas shoes, so I walked around
  with wet socks for most of the day.  Today I&#8217;m prepared.  I&#8217;m wearing
  a rain pancho, and I think that&#8217;s going to be my look for the whole
  day.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  When I got to work, we were in the
  middle of something called a &#8220;sev 4&#8221; incident, which in short means
  something&#8217;s about to break.  We all sat silently combing over metrics
  and reading change logs for about an hour before we finally found the
  culprit.  We alerted the team, they reverted the change, and the
  graphs immediately began to trend down to more palatable numbers.  It
  was a pretty good win for our team.  In previous months, something
  like this probably would have gone unnoticed until it caused an actual
  incident, so the fact that we were able to anticipate an incident and
  resolve it before it happened is something to be proud about.  We
  moved all of our morning meetings to the afternoon, so I ate lunch and
  went for a long walk.</p>
<p>While I was heating up my cheeseburger in the break room, a coworker
  of mine innocently asked &#8220;where did you get that cheeseburger, is it
  from Walgreen&#8217;s?&#8221;  His exact wording made me erupt in laughter.  The
  night before while I was trying to convince Marissa of how terrible my
  cheeseburgers were, my closing argument was &#8220;Look at it!  Just look at
  it on the plate, it looks like one of those frozen cheeseburgers from
  Walgreen&#8217;s I used to eat!&#8221;  The reference sidetracked our play
  argument.  &#8220;Why did you walk to Walgreen&#8217;s and not to Novanta, they&#8217;re
  right next to each other,&#8221; she asked.  &#8220;Probably because we were tight
  on money, and those cheeseburgers were only $2.50,&#8221; I laughed.</p>
<p>The rest of the work day went pretty swimmingly, and soon I was on a
  bus headed for home.  I threw together a shopping list, then scrolled
  through twitter until we reached my stop.  Marissa was at the front
  window making a bug eyed face at me as I walked up our driveway.  When
  I walked in, Marissa eagerly gave me a tour of all the rooms she
  tidied up while I was gone.  We chatted for a bit, then Rodney ran
  around the corner and gave me a hug.  I scooped him up, put his shoes
  on, then we went to the grocery store.</p>
<p>We had a big grocery list to get through.  I wanted to make hutspot,
  saucijzenbroodjes, and try out a new cabbage &amp; onion side.  Marissa
  was also out of ingredients to make her salad.</p>
<p><i>Sip</i>.  Ah, Marissa&#8217;s salad.  Let&#8217;s pause yesterday&#8217;s recap and talk
  about this salad.  Romaine lettuce, sweet corn, red onion, Mexican
  cheese, cherry tomatoes, avocado, and BRIANNA&#8217;S HOMESTYLE cilantro
  lime flavored salad dressing all make up her favorite Mexican salad.
  She&#8217;s made it for me a few times, and personally, I think it&#8217;s too
  much red onion.  It&#8217;s a lot of red onion.  Like a whole red onion
  diced up, and all the other ingredients are basically just plunged in
  a cut up red onion.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, I hate picking up the ingredients for this salad.
  It used to be a big point of contention for us.  Earlier in our
  marriage we&#8217;ve had some real arguments that culminated in me flinging
  bags of old lettuce and cheese out of the fridge trying to demonstrate
  the chaos this salad has brought upon our home life.  Some days I
  would come back from the grocery store and yell up to her &#8220;FIFTEEN
  MINUTES.  TOOK ME FIFTEEN MINUTES TO FIND ALL THE INGREDIENTS FOR THIS
  SALAD.&#8221;  Before we used to regularly clean our fridge, we would
  unknowingly purchase duplicate bottles of BRIANNA&#8217;S HOMESTYLE cilantro
  lime flavored salad dressing, and one summer night while I was
  cleaning through the fridge I found four unopened bottles.  I proudly
  lined them all up on the counter like a lion with a fresh kill.</p>
<p>My time is almost up, and I guess I burned the rest of this entry
  teasing my wife about her favorite salad.  We&#8217;re older and wiser now,
  and I think this salad has finally gotten into teasing territory -
  I&#8217;ll hear about it if it hasn&#8217;t.  It&#8217;s actually not bad, as long as
  you go easy on the red onion.  And if I&#8217;m such a salad critic, you&#8217;d
  think I&#8217;d have a favorite salad.  I really don&#8217;t.  I find salads kind
  of obnoxious to make.  Just know this - if you ever eat dinner at my
  house and I put a salad down in front of you, know that I must really
  care about you.  And it probably took me fifteen minutes tracking all
  over Hy-Vee to get the ingredients, I had to slice and rinse all those
  stupid ingredients and toss them in a bowl, and you better appreciate
  it.</p>
<p>This has been <i>Salad Ranting</i> with Alex.  Hope you have a great day
  today.</p>
