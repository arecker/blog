<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re doing well today.  Before I
  jumped in the shower, I checked the weather, and it&#8217;s looks like it&#8217;s
  supposed to be another chilly day.  Hopefully we get some more snow on
  the ground before heading into the holiday season.  The older I get, I
  find it harder and harder to summon enthusiasm for the Christmas
  spirit.  I love seeing family, getting time off work, and of course
  getting gifts from people, but everything else about Christmas is on
  thin ice with me.  This year, a little bit of snow on the ground could
  help its case against me.  And now that I&#8217;m delving into dangerous
  <i>humbug</i> territory - not wanting to out myself as a staunch Christmas
  hater, I had better change the subject.</p>
<p>I did some more reading in my Difficult Conversations book yesterday.
  After cleaning up from diner, I rolled into bed and finished the
  second of four sections.  I read about emotions, how they should
  affect confrontations, and how we can better understand them.  I found
  the conversation stimulating and enlightening.  Just between you and
  me, reader, these Harvard nerds really know their stuff.  One of the
  things the authors discussed was how the tendency to blame other
  things for a problem is usually a clue that you are holding onto
  unexpressed emotions.  This struck a chord with me, and it actually
  caused me to get up and crack open my anger journal.  Luckily, I
  haven&#8217;t had a new entry in a number of weeks, with a close call being
  the big microwaved frozen polish sausage scandal of last Sunday.
  Blame was a common theme.  The word &#8220;blame&#8221; appeared at least once in
  every entry.  The discovery caused me to stare into space, replaying
  how I felt when I cut open one of the polish sausages last Sunday and
  beheld the cold, pink center.  I wanted to blame the recipe video I
  watched on YouTube.  I wanted to blame Marissa for buying the wrong
  sausages.  I wanted to blame Rodney for distracting me by playing in
  the sink pretending to help me cook.</p>
<p>Something else the book talked about was the skill of negotiating
  with your feelings.  My emotions have always been a black and white
  battlefield, but according to the book, your perception of a situation
  is subjective, and if emotions arise from your perception, then they
  would have to be subjective as well, right?  The authors used spotting
  a shark as an example.  If you were swimming in the deep ocean and you
  spotted a shark swimming towards you, you might feel scared and
  anxious, and your emotions will take over and tell you to either hold
  still or swim backwards as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>But if you were a trained marine biologist instead of a mere casual
  swimmer, you might spot the shark and recognize it as a whale shark,
  assuring yourself you are in no danger and the little guy is just
  sniffing around for some krill or squid.  Suddenly your perception of
  the situation changes and those emotions magically dissipate.</p>
<p>As we climb the entries of my anger journal, it appears I was already
  starting to figure out how to negotiate with my emotions.  In these
  entries, I challenge my need to blame things.  For example, when I
  felt the need to blame Marissa for buying the wrong sausages, I
  reminded myself that she was unsure about them, and upon showing them
  to me after getting home from the store I said aloud &#8220;those will
  work - I&#8217;ll cut &#8216;em in half so they can fit on a hot dog bun.&#8221;  And if
  she had really bought the wrong kind of sausages, wouldn&#8217;t I have
  recognized it then?  Or would I at least share the blame in signing
  off on them as well?  Maybe I should have moved them from the freezer
  to the fridge a little sooner.  So those are my reading reflections
  thus far.  Next reading session goes into how difficult conversations
  can impact your identity.</p>
<p>Sobering reflections aside, yesterday was a pretty great &amp; easy day.
  I had meetings most of the day, and I cut work early so we could go
  take a family photo on Barb&#8217;s farm.  So if we&#8217;re still pretending this
  week is the pre-holiday gauntlet, this must also be the smallest
  gauntlet to have ever been thrown.  We drove to Barb&#8217;s place, took
  some photos outside in their yard, then head inside their dog training
  facility to let the dogs burn off some energy.  Marissa talks often
  about how fun it is to watch Ollie and Ziggy open the throttle in a
  big area, and witnessing it first hand was a treat.  I love the way
  dogs let their tongue flop out of their mouth to gain more speed, as
  if it&#8217;s a performance tradeoff.</p>
<p>I dozed off for about twenty minutes as Marissa drove back, and on the
  way home, letting Rodney continue sleeping in the car, I ran into
  Hy-Vee to pick up dinner.  I made pork rigatoni, which is really
  starting to climb the ranks in terms of meals I enjoy cooking.  I render
  the fat out of some pancietta, toss in lemon zest, sliced garlic,
  tomato paste, and oregano, then dump in the sauce - remembering to
  rince the bottle with a little bit of water.  Then I cook the sauce
  down a bit to taste.  I reduce the heat, add some butter, then when
  the pasta is barely cooked, I drain it, sneaking away some of the
  pasta water for later.  I let the rigatoni sit in the sauce for a few
  minutes, then add pasta water and grated parmesan, which turns into a
  pretty seductive looking and smelling cheese sauce.  As a finishing
  touch, I throw in a fist full of chopped parsley and let it sit for
  just a few more minutes.  Chopped parsley in pasta might be one of my
  favorite things in the universe.</p>
<p>After dinner, I had some chores to do, as well as some holiday related
  stuff.  The last part of my gift from my Bears subreddit secret santa
  arrived, so I had to snap a pic of all the gifts together and write a
  quick Internet thank-you.  Along with a hat for Rodney, he bought me a
  pair of sweatpants as well as a Bears themed tequila glass.  And
  having just lost to the Packers last Sunday, there was an obvious joke
  in the implied theme of cozy self-loathing and drinking.</p>
<p>Before I sign off, here&#8217;s another observation.  Football makes it way
  easier to talk to strangers.  Football is the great equalizer, and a
  powerful white noise that can overcome any shyness or awkward
  conversations.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I got today.  I hope you have a wonderful day today, and
  as always, thanks for reading.</p>
