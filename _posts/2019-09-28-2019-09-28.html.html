<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Happy Saturday.  Hope you&#8217;re taking it slow
  this morning.  The entry is a little late because I slept in, and I
  also decided that making French toast was a bigger priority.  Now that
  breakfast is out of the way, and Rodney is content watching Blue&#8217;s
  Clues on the couch, I&#8217;m free to write.</p>
<p>I also had to catch up on chores this morning - wiping down the
  counters, starting another load of dishes, and cleaning up after
  Friday night pizza.  All things that I normally do on Friday night,
  but last night I got sucked into all the hype and drama leading up to
  a new Kanye Album.  For the last few weeks, there have been rumors
  floating around that he&#8217;s getting ready to release a gospel album
  called <i>Jesus Is King</i>.  He even tweeted a picture of the track list
  and a date - 9/27.  I&#8217;ve been following Kanye for a while now, and
  I&#8217;ve learned that only about half the albums that he announces
  actually get released, and the name of the album usually changes a few
  times too.  So last night I was counting on his release date falling
  through.  Then, while browsing reddit, I noticed people freaking out
  about a listening party in Detroit.  Despite the concert being very
  closely monitored, a few leaks got out and once I heard them, I knew
  it was the real deal.  Before I knew it, I was falling down the rabbit
  hole, studying every piece of gossip that rolled out of Detroit&#8217;s Fox
  theater.  First, it was rumored to be released at 8PM&#8230; then 9PM (8PM
  Chicago time)&#8230; then 11PM.  Soon, Kim announced on her Instagram that
  the album was being pushed to Sunday.</p>
<p>So mission accomplished, Kanye West.  You&#8217;ve whipped me into a frenzy
  over a fake release date, and now you have my close attention.  Hey,
  at least the next alleged release date is on, of all days, my golden
  birthday.  That&#8217;s pretty cool.  And even if the album still doesn&#8217;t
  drop, how many people that you know can say &#8220;Kanye West ruined my
  golden birthday&#8221;?  Not many I imagine.</p>
<p>Defeated and albumless, I packed up the pizza leftovers and joined
  Marissa on the back porch.  We quietly listened to some Kanye and
  chatted, talking about his past albums and where we thought this next
  album was going to take him.  It actually got a little heated - Kanye
  is one of those artists that digs into your personal life.  His albums
  get wrapped up with your memories, and the music is almost seasoned
  with what you were going through at that time in your life.  If you&#8217;re
  not careful, telling another Kanye fan &#8220;I disagree with how you feel
  about that album&#8221; almost comes across as a personal jab.  That&#8217;s the
  mark of a good artist, right?</p>
<p>Marissa and I headed inside to watch a movie.  It was my pick, and I
  went with the very under-appreciated gem <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7C8nHAAs70">Be Kind Rewind</a>.  I first saw
  this movie in high school while spending the night at a friends house.
  The marketing made it look like yet another silly Jack Black movie,
  but it&#8217;s actually a pretty thoughtful &amp; touching flick about a town
  trying to protect their legacy.  And if it helps, the movie is only
  about 30% Jack Black.  Mos Def and Danny Glover are also a cool touch.
  We had about a third left of the movie before we decided to turn in
  for the night.</p>
<p>This morning, Rod and I are holding down the fort while Marissa and
  the dogs head to Milwaukee for another agility trial.  She just left a
  minute ago.  Beforehand, we snapped a few pictures of some very large,
  beautiful paintings she&#8217;s about to ship off.  I always imagine how
  weird it must be seeing me, unshowered and greasy from cooking
  breakfast, standing in the front yard taking pictures of a very put
  together Marissa in front of her beautiful work.  It&#8217;s probably quite
  the contrast.  Anyway, she just took off, now it&#8217;s just me and the Rod
  man.  After journaling, I&#8217;m going to put his laundry away, then we&#8217;re
  going to shower up and walk to the grocery store, picking up lunch
  along the way.  There&#8217;s a bar in Atwood that allows dogs, and today
  might be a good day to scope it out and pick up a bite to eat.  After
  we get home, I&#8217;ll probably put him down for a nap, get ready for
  dinner, and then stay on this Kanye gossip.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful Saturday.</p>
