<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.  Happy Sunday.  After a busy Saturday of
  traveling and working in the basement, the whole family slept in this
  morning.  I woke up a little past 9:30, hearing Rodney rustling toys
  and books around in his bedroom.  By 10, we were all on the couch
  watching YouTube and eating omelettes, and so far that&#8217;s the mood for
  today.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a great day, but a busy one.  Before jumping in the car
  to head to Alice&#8217;s birthday party, Marissa could be seen on the
  kitchen floor trimming the dogs&#8217; nails, and Rodney was busily darting
  around the play room packing his backpack with toys.  I was packing
  peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the road and clearing out our
  fridge of any especially volatile leftovers.  We hit the road, and
  after putting in Kelly and Jeremy&#8217;s address into the GPS, we
  congratulated ourselves for the perfect timing.  Our ETA was twenty
  minutes before the party would start, allowing almost the perfect
  amount of time for a coffee &amp; potty stop in my old stomping grounds of
  the Streets of Woodfield.</p>
<p>We parked, and with Marissa remaining in the car with the dogs
  contently snuggling in the back seat, Rodney and I walked hand-in-hand
  through the busy mall parking lot.  We found the bathroom in the back
  corner of the cafe.  &#8220;Dude, I used to clean this bathroom every single
  night,&#8221; I said, helping Rodney use the potty.</p>
<p>Rodney and I waited in line, ordering two cups of coffee and a
  birthday cake pop.  Rodney politely thanked the Barista, and climbed
  up onto the high chair beside the bar.  Returning to the car, I smiled
  handing Marissa the cup of coffee.  &#8220;I sprung for something special,&#8221;
  I said.  &#8220;Something that you can only get here.&#8221;  They had Jamaica
  Blue Mountain on the menu, and it had been too long since I got to
  taste what I would confidently call the most perfect coffee on earth.
  Mellow, fruity, nutty - it tastes like the inside of a leather
  suitcase smells, or like how it feels to ride in a limo.  As we got
  back on the road, I reminisced with Marissa about how lucky I felt to
  drink one of these practically whenever I felt like it while working
  at that store.</p>
<p>We arrived at Alice&#8217;s house.  Kelly greeted us by the curb, holding a
  handful of items that they had accidentally taken home with them when
  they stayed at our place.  &#8220;Here, we have stuff you left at our house
  too,&#8221; I said, retrieving a phone charger from my coat pocket.  &#8220;We&#8217;ll
  probably do this every time we see each other,&#8221; I joked.</p>
<p>Kelly and Jeremy&#8217;s house was already buzzing with family.  Herb and
  Beth were hanging around, Kelly was in the kitchen, and Alice had
  already stolen Rodney away to play with toys and jump on the couch.
  Seeing our dogs, Frankie excitedly waddled over to us, leaning in for
  a kiss from Ziggy.  I helped myself to some beer after finishing my
  coffee.</p>
<p>More family started trickling in, and after greeting everyone, we
  found seats in the living room.  Becca, Ollie, and Ziggy played in a
  frenzy while Jo-Jo stoically looked on from the sidelines, her chest
  puffed out like a body guard, staring blankly at the wall.</p>
<p>After opening presents, little Frankie commandeered Alice&#8217;s new orange
  dinosaur toy.  One by one, she would pick someone sitting on the
  couch, waddle over to them, and growl as loud as she could, which from
  a baby like her, amounted to just a silly little gurgle.  We egged her
  on, recoiling in fear and sending her in another direction.  All the
  while, Jo-Jo still stood stoically, making the whole thing even
  funnier.</p>
<p>After eating some chicken pot pie, I followed Rodney and Alice into
  the basement.  Almost as if she needed a break from the craziness of
  her own party, Alice jumped onto my lap and handed me a story book.
  &#8220;Is this <i>Giraffes Can&#8217;t Dance</i>?  Alice, I LOVE this book,&#8221; I said
  enthusiastically.  As I read, I mixed in some Dutch words, as I
  normally do with Rodney, but it was extra funny since Alice would look
  at me with wide eyes and correct me.  &#8220;Not <i>olifant</i>,&#8221; she said.
  &#8221;<i>Elephant</i>&#8221;.  She corrected me with perfect diction.  &#8220;Oh oh OK, I
  sorry,&#8221; I replied.  I followed Alice and Rodney upstairs, where we
  enjoyed a homemade Dinosaur cake made by Sarah.</p>
<p>After bidding everyone farewell, we packed the car and hit the road.
  My eyes started to get heavy after an hour of driving, so Marissa
  agreed to take over for the second leg.  We stopped at an oasis.  As
  Marissa waited in the drive through at McDonalds, I took Rodney inside
  to use the bathroom.  In a slight oversight, I left his shoes in the
  car, and while wearing only his socks, it proved to be a bit of a
  challenge helping him use the bathroom without touching the floor.</p>
<p>Rodney was in bed by 9:30, and after a quick break outside, I changed
  into some work clothes and joined Marissa in the basement with a box
  of black garbage bags.  We set aside last night after the party to
  tear down the old resin tent - a large structure made up of PVC tubing
  and clear plastic tarp taped together.  Marissa hacked down the tarp
  with a pocket knife while I cut and wiggled the PVC tubing free.</p>
<p>Next came the table, which was caked with a thick layer of runoff
  resin.  On top of the table, latex gloves, paint sticks, and empty
  plastic cups were adhered to the surface.  Once removed from the resin
  tent, it actually looked more like an interesting art exhibit than
  something we were just trying to get into the garbage.</p>
<p>Marissa tried to saw the table in half, but there was too much resin
  to cut through.  We instead bent and broke the table legs off, and
  together carried the table out to the porch.</p>
<p>Finally, we had to deal with the floor, pieced together with that
  black spongy material you might see in a day care or in a school gym,
  only it was also adhered together with runoff resin.  I spent the rest
  of the night hacking, cracking, and tearing it free, stuffing the
  pieces into garbage bags.  At 11:15, we declared victory, sinking into
  the couch.  That may have been the hardest I&#8217;ve worked all year, and
  after a whole day sitting in the car, it felt good to move, work and
  sweat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt like a kid waking up on Christmas morning,&#8221; said Marisa today.
  I too took an extra minute to happily wander around and check on our
  work.  With the demolition complete, today is the easy part.  After
  running some errands and picking up lunch at Portillo&#8217;s, we&#8217;re going
  to set up the new resin tent, which will use a much more practical
  collapsible curtain.  Between finishing the tent and shoveling the
  fresh snow that fell last night, there will be no shortage of work
  today.</p>
<p>Hope you have a great Sunday.  Let&#8217;s soak it up before the beginning
  of another busy work week.</p>
