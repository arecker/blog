<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Yesterday was a productive day.  The morning was filled with planning
  meetings, and in the afternoon the interns and I finally fixed access
  in their project.  It felt good to delete all the half measures and
  work around we were relying on, and it really cleaned things up.
  After work, I took Rod to Hy-Vee.  Marissa warned me that he was still
  a little grumpy from driving so much the day before.  We decided to
  give him some slack today.  We had a mini tantrum in the bakery
  section when I said he couldn&#8217;t eat a bread butt.  He was already
  eating a banana, and I think he forgot that I make him pick between
  the two.</p>
<p>When we got home, Rodney joined Marissa outside to work on pouring
  planter rocks, and I got to work on dinner.  I made chicken
  <i>saltimbocca</i>, which I miraculously finished on time.  At some point,
  while you&#8217;re pounding the chicken breasts flat, seasoning each side,
  and gently tamping down a layer prosciutto through cling wrap, you
  start to wonder if you&#8217;re even going to have food on the table before
  10pm.  But it&#8217;s one of those meals that you just have to stick with,
  and while it takes a while to assemble, the thin chicken cuts only
  take about five minutes to cook through.  All the food was on the
  table by 7:05, which is only 5 minutes late by my standards.</p>
<p>It was nice to sit down as a family at our own dinner table.  We
  chatted about home projects, work, and what Spider-Man episodes Rod is
  currently really into.  After dinner, we put Rod to bed.  We read <i>Are
  You My Mother?</i>, which is a nice, mellow weeknight favorite.</p>
<p>For the rest of the night, Marissa hung out in the kitchen to work on
  some wedding shower stuff, and I caught up on chores around the house.
  Tuesday is garbage day, so I try to empty out all the garbages in the
  house.  If you do the same thing, don&#8217;t forget about the little
  garbages - like in the bathroom, the car, or the bedroom.  Those
  little garbages can add up.</p>
<p>As a study snack, I cut up some french bread I bought from the grocery
  store today.  I wiped a little pad of butter on each slice and heated
  up the plate in the microwave.  That&#8217;s how my mom used to serve it up,
  and I think it&#8217;s the best.</p>
<p>I finished the night with some computer time.  I worked on a time
  lapse for Marissa, and in between all the exporting and uploading, I
  worked on some code.  I&#8217;m really starting to surprise myself with how
  long I&#8217;m sticking to this side project.  I&#8217;ve even started using the
  tool on my own computer to manage some configs.</p>
<p>I never got around to opening up the basement computer.  There wasn&#8217;t
  a lot of kitchen table space available, so I decided to just put it
  off a night.</p>
<p>We wrapped up work around midnight.  We thought about squeezing in an
  episode of <i>New Girl</i>, but we did the more prudent thing and just went
  to bed.  We have a long week ahead of us, and it&#8217;s best to rest up
  while you can, you know?</p>
<p>Today will probably feel a lot like yesterday - work, lunch, work,
  groceries, dinner, chores, rest.  I&#8217;m also hoping to finally open up
  the computer and start making a list of the parts I need to rebuild it
  on the wall.  At some point today, I also need to pick a recipe to
  make for concert on the square, although I may have already settled on
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJUiWdM__Qw">pasta aglio</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a Tuesday!  We have a long week ahead of us, but just focus
  on what you want to do today.  And go easy on yourself, it&#8217;s only
  Tuesday.  If you&#8217;re tempted to stay up a little later to cross
  something off the to-do list, just save it for tomorrow.  Sleep is
  more important.  Hope you have a wonderful day today.</p>
