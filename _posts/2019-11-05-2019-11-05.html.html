<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone.  Hope you&#8217;re doing well today on this sunny,
  chilly Tuesday morning.  Last night, my wife cut my hair, and keeping
  the personal grooming momentum going, I also shaved - but not the
  beard.  I&#8217;m growing things out for no-shave-november.  A few weeks
  ago, my coworker sent me a link to our work&#8217;s &#8220;Movember&#8221; charity team
  and I joined.  I think the idea is that a bunch of guys grow silly
  mustaches and beards, and people donate money to charity in approval.
  I&#8217;m happy to tag a long for the ride, especially if now I get a more
  concrete excuse to look like a wild man all month.  So enjoy the clean
  shaven me while you still can, things are going to get hairy this
  month - all for charity of course.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  I had plenty of things to do in the
  morning, including filing for paternity leave in the spring, figuring
  out insurance stuff, and going to a few meetings, but I remembered to
  make time for the half hour Ki Gong session on the ninth floor.  I was
  delighted to find that Justin, our instructor, switched up the routine
  a bit.  After the half hour of meditative movements and breathing, I
  commended him for the new set.  &#8220;That routine was created by a Chinese
  general in the year 1000,&#8221; he explained.  &#8220;It was designed to keep
  their archers relaxed, and to give relief to the men who had been
  marching all day in heavy armor.&#8221;  I suddenly had a clear picture in
  my head.  As part of the session, we breathed deeply while miming a
  bow and arrow, and we bounced on our toes, stamping our heels into the
  ground.  I can&#8217;t say I was wearing heavy armor, or marching all day at
  the bidding of a warlord, but maybe my suffering as an office worker
  compares if we&#8217;re willing to embellish the metaphorical route.  &#8220;But
  still useful to us - we all still march in heavy armor, in our own
  way,&#8221; I said smugly.  &#8220;How philosophical!&#8221; Justin laughed.</p>
<p>I grabbed lunch at Starbucks.  I asked them to heat up a ham and swiss
  pannini, and I ordered an iced tea.  Eating at Starbucks is a guilty
  pleasure, but I&#8217;m more in it for the nostalgia than for the food
  itself.  It takes me back to working late nights, skimming an extra
  sandwich off the &#8216;expired&#8217; pile and finding a quite corner of the
  store to spend my lunch.  Even though I&#8217;m in a different place working
  a much different job, quietly eating my pannini in Starbucks feels
  exactly the same - if not a little better, since I&#8217;m no longer limited
  to the sandwiches that expired.</p>
<p>After work, Marissa, Rodney, and I went to Hy-Vee to pick up dinner.
  The deal was that I would wait in line to get a flu shot while Marissa
  and Rodney picked up supplies for taco dinner.  I filled out some
  paperwork, then waited almost a whole hour.  Marissa and Rodney waited
  with me for the last ten minutes before Marissa finally gave me the
  <i>lets get the hell out of here</i> eyes.  Even though I had every right
  to throw a little salt at the lady behind the counter, my Midwestern
  sensibilities got the best of me.  &#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry,&#8221; I said.  &#8220;I
  ordered a flu shot, but we gotta get goin&#8217;, really sorry about this.&#8221;</p>
<p>I watched TV on the couch with Rod while Marissa made tacos.  It was a
  wonderful meal, and it hit the spot.  For all the cooking we do, I
  don&#8217;t have a very deep bench when it comes to Mexican food, so tacos -
  even simply made with ground beef, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes -
  have an exciting presence on our dinner table.</p>
<p>We put Rod to bed, then I got to work on chores.  Last night was the
  first night I tried my new Monday through Thursday nesting &#8216;power
  hour&#8217;.  Marissa rolled her eyes when she saw it on our family
  calendar.  &#8220;You should move that to your calendar - it makes us look a
  lot busier than we are,&#8221; she said.  That was a fair ask.</p>
<p>For power hour, I cleaned the landing by our back door, which had kind
  of turned into an awkward little dumping ground for things stuck in
  limbo between the basement and the main floor.  The middle shelf was
  spilling out with half empty boxes of garbage bags and parchment
  paper, and the bottom shelf was filled with swiffer wet jet refills
  that - ironically - were covered in dust and dog hair.  After I had
  finished that corner, I made my way to under the sink.  It wasn&#8217;t
  nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  We just had a few nearly
  empty bottles of cleaning solution that we no longer used, and an
  expired fire extinguisher.  I smiled when I saw the gauge resting on
  &#8216;empty/expired&#8217;.  That meant that I could play with it outside before
  discarding it.</p>
<p>Standing in the middle of the street, I aimed, pulled the plastic tag,
  and squeezed the lever.  A chalky white dust leaked out onto the
  street, catching the wind and vanishing into the night.  Very
  anticlimactic, but I was grateful to have this disappointing
  experience without a blazing kitchen fire in the mix.</p>
<p>After chores and haircuts, Marissa and I sat down at the computer to
  figure out our shared calendar for the month of December.  I let her
  drive this time, so the planning wouldn&#8217;t be sidetracked by when we
  eat breakfast and when the Bears play.</p>
<p>We concluded the night by watching a few minutes of <i>The Karate Kid</i>,
  which is another one of those movies that I&#8217;ve deceived myself into
  thinking I&#8217;ve already watched it.  I&#8217;m pretty sure this movie is
  completely new to me, so no spoilers, OK?  I&#8217;ll tell you one thing - I
  have a feeling that rude maintenance worker he met in the apartment
  building will be coming back in the story, he seemed interesting.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I got today!  Hope you have a great day today.  Whatever
  &#8220;armor&#8221; you&#8217;re wearing and wherever you&#8217;re &#8220;marching&#8221;, make sure you
  take some time today to breathe, empty your head, and shake out all
  the stress, the Ki Gong way.  Thanks for reading.</p>
