<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  We&#8217;re having a late start this morning.  Even
  though we&#8217;ve only been away from the house for three days, it feels
  like longer.  I suppose Rodney has been away for a week, so he&#8217;s the
  most deserving of a relaxing day.  Today, there couldn&#8217;t be any less
  on the agenda.  We&#8217;re sitting around the breakfast table enjoying a
  Dutch baby and Marissa and I are enjoying the maiden voyage of our new
  Dutch coffee maker.  I had full confidence in the new coffee machine -
  so much so that I slipped our old Black and Dekker coffee machine into
  the garbage before I even took the new one out of the box.  And my
  confidence was not misplaced.  This coffee tastes like it was crafted
  in the most hipster of coffee shops, and I love how futuristic it
  looks on our coffee bar.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a long, fulfilling day.  After slowly emerging from bed,
  Sam whipped us up some pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage.  Adam was
  already at work.  &#8220;He gets up around five,&#8221; Sam explained.  &#8220;And it&#8217;s
  still a long day for him, he usually finishes around three or four.&#8221;
  After finishing up breakfast and getting in some last sips of coffee,
  Marissa, Rodney, and I packed our stuff and prepared to go to the
  gallery.  With Sam in the front seat and Marissa squeezed in the back
  seat behind one of her paintings, we carefully navigated the tight
  city streets, winding crowded intersections, turning into a small
  alley, and finally delicately turning into our reserved parking spot.
  The gallery spot was beautiful - wide, clean floors and walls, a high
  ceiling, big beautiful glass doors that opened up to the street, and
  they even had a ping-pong table in the back.  Rodney grabbed a ball
  and paddle and got to fiddling while Marissa, Sam, and I unpacked the
  car.  In a matter of minutes, we were set up and ready to open the
  doors.</p>
<p>I was proud of Marissa.  She&#8217;s done galleries like this before, but
  something about this Logan Square venue she rented really felt like a
  store front.  Seeing Marissa answer questions and chat with curious
  locals made the fantasy of someday owning a storefront seem more
  palpable and real.</p>
<p>And the gallery was popular.  With only a hand made wooden sign that
  said &#8220;Astuary Art - open gallery&#8221; to guide them, people started to
  wander in immediately.</p>
<p>As Marissa and Sam held down the storefront, Rodney and I played
  ping-pong in the back room.  We went for a walk to pick up some
  coffee, then later on went on another excursion with Sam to pick up
  lunch.  We chose a taco place, lured in by the smell of grilled
  chicken, fresh salsa, and carne asada.  As Rodney and I shared a steak
  burrito in the back room by the ping-pong table, Marissa poked her
  head in to silently mime a fist pump, celebrating another sale.</p>
<p>After lunch, Rodney and I went for another walk around the
  neighborhood.  He was quiet, and even insisted on walking about twenty
  feet behind me with his hands in his pockets.  After pressing him a
  bit, it seemed like he was OK, but just wanted some alone time.  And
  that&#8217;s understandable.  He had been away from his house since getting
  picked up by Grandma last Sunday, and has had a busy week playing with
  his cousins, going to the museum, spending the night at Uncle Adam &amp;
  Auntie Sam&#8217;s place, and now helping out at the gallery.</p>
<p>As a side note, Rodney has the hardest time saying &#8220;Uncle Adam.&#8221;  Each
  time he tried to get Uncle Adam&#8217;s attention, he accidentally said
  &#8220;Uncle Alex&#8221;, or even &#8220;Uncle <i>Ass</i>&#8221; on occasion, which Sam was a fan
  of.  The <i>d</i> sound is hard, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>But there we were, slowly and pensively wandering around the Logan
  Square neighborhood, and while Rodney was trudging along with his
  hands in his pockets, he still stopped to ask to pet someone&#8217;s dog,
  ask a stranger about riding the bus, and of course wish <i>happy
  holidays</i> to even the most surly of city slickers that passed by.  I
  even took the opportunity to snap a few dramatic band pics of Rodney.
  I think he&#8217;ll thank me for that later in life.  Wandering around the
  city with his hood up, he looked undeniably cool, even for a three
  year old.</p>
<p>Finally, it came time to close the gallery doors.  We packed the car,
  then swung by the house to grab the rest of our things and bid a
  farewell to Ginny - Adam and Sam&#8217;s dog.  She frolicked with Rodney in
  the living room as I inched my way down the winding, crooked city
  steps.  We waved to Sam as we turned on a street and left the
  neighborhood.  I could see Ginny happily bouncing in the rear view
  mirror.  Ginny the dog left an impression on me.  She&#8217;s the kind of
  dog that is so happy to be alive, it&#8217;s almost a living, breathing
  challenge to attack your own life with the same joy and ferocity.</p>
<p>Rodney fell asleep before I even got on the highway, the lurching of
  Chicago traffic lulling him to sleep like a slow boat.  Marissa and I
  chatted about the weekend and gallery for a bit before she too finally
  succumbed to a car nap.  &#8220;Do you want me to put on a podcast for you?&#8221;
  asked Marissa, breaking a long, haggard yawn.  &#8220;Nah, I don&#8217;t mind just
  sitting here.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long, rewarding, fulfilling weekend, but we&#8217;re happy to be
  home.  At three today, we are going to pick up our dogs, and the rest
  of our Sunday schedule has been emptied in the interest of staying in
  our pajamas, watching Christmas movies around our tree, and soaking up
  family time before another work week.  Later today, I&#8217;m going to sneak
  out to the grocery store.  Tonight, I&#8217;m making pork and cabbage soup -
  which will hopefully bring us back from the teetering edge of
  exhaustion induced soar throats and sniffles we&#8217;re all feeling.</p>
<p>To Marissa&#8217;s fans in Chicago, thanks for coming out and supporting us.
  Galleries are always scary.  It takes a lot of faith to pile every
  painting you have in the car and drive it all to a new city.  There&#8217;s
  always a danger that we picked the wrong spot, or picked the wrong
  weekend, which is why we&#8217;re grateful for the love and support.  &#8220;This
  place was awesome,&#8221; Marissa said while packing up.  &#8220;We have to do
  Chicago again.&#8221;</p>
