<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Tuesday.</p>
<p>Oof.  My stomach is doing somersaults this morning.  Readers, I think
  two days straight of junk food is finally catching up with me.  But
  even though my stomach is filled with some bad stuff at the moment, my
  head is filled with fun memories from yesterday, and my heart is full.
  Yesterday, it felt great to head back into work knowing I was finally
  not on duty anymore.  I treated myself to some Starbucks on the way
  in.  We had a few meetings, I worked in the morning, then heated some
  some leftovers.  As I ate, I chatted with Marissa about the plan for
  the day.  She had forgotten that she needed the car that evening for a
  dog agility class she was auditing, so picking up groceries and
  cooking dinner was likely not happening.  &#8220;Dave &amp; Busters?&#8221; she
  suggested.  &#8220;YES,&#8221; I responded, quickly lighting up the chat window.
  The weather has been so dreary lately, and it&#8217;s hard to get the energy
  to do fun stuff in the evening when there is so little light.  But
  D&amp;B&#8217;s is like a casino, where the inside is specifically designed to
  obscure what time of day it is.</p>
<p>By Marissa&#8217;s report, once she told Rod about the evening plan with
  dad, he wouldn&#8217;t stop talking about it.  As she recapped, he lied
  awake in bed when he was supposed to be napping, telling each of his
  stuffed animals about the plan to go <i>play games with dad</i>.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I was excited too.  Not only is it fun to watch
  Rodney burn energy in a place like that, but I was in the mood for a
  plate of junk food.</p>
<p>Marissa dropped us off around 5:30.  Rodney and I wandered around a
  bit, following his whims.  I find that if he doesn&#8217;t get at least five
  minutes to see all the games up close, he&#8217;s too distracted to eat
  dinner.  As he had his face pressed on the glass of a mechanical claw
  game, I suddenly remembered that I may have still had some leftover
  points on my D&amp;B&#8217;s power card, which I proudly carry in my wallet
  beneath my license - half ironically.</p>
<p>We scanned the machine and it whirred to life.  I moved the claw in
  position over a little pile of themed rubber ducks, and Rodney slammed
  the button with two hands.  The claw sputtered, then lowered over the
  bath toys and snagged one by the neck.  Rodney stared through the
  glass, puzzled.  &#8220;You got one dude!&#8221; I yelled.  The duck rolled into
  the little metal box above the floor.  I fished it out for him - he
  studied the duck then held it close.  We played the claw game one more
  time, this time Rod got excited about operating the crane himself.
  This game must have been rigged in our favor, because he immediately
  snagged another and fished it out.</p>
<p>We found a table, and as we waited for our food, I sipped and we
  watched all fifteen plasma TVs simultaneously.  &#8220;DAD LOOK.  BASEBALL.
  OH DAD LOOK.  FOOTBALL.  OH DAD LOOK, HOCKEY.&#8221;  I think the real magic
  of Dave &amp; Buster&#8217;s is how good of a job it is at distraction.  It&#8217;s
  really hard to worry about any part of the real world while inside -
  not that I had anything to worry about.</p>
<p>Rodney ate a few chicken fingers, and I cleaned a small plate of hot
  wings.  As we ate, we chatted about the games we wanted to play and
  the sports that were on the TV.  There&#8217;s not much to talk about with a
  three year old, but all things considered, Rodney is great company.
  Sometimes he&#8217;ll even start new topics, like &#8220;Hey - where&#8217;s Momma?&#8221;
  &#8220;Great question, dude.  Do you remember where you last saw her?&#8221;</p>
<p>As per usual, we waited a solid twenty-or-so minutes before getting
  our check.  Rodney anxiously jumped on the cushioned set, waiting to
  be unleashed on some games.  Finally, we paid our bill, recharged our
  power card, then spent the evening bouncing from game to game.  Rod
  figured out how to spend the points himself, but I did my best to keep
  him from burning points on car games, since we had just as much fun
  sitting behind the wheel and pretending to drive.  We played a few
  rounds of ski ball - he wasn&#8217;t quite strong enough to get the wall all
  the way up to any of the point scoring holes, so we celebrated each
  gutterball as if it were a bullseye.</p>
<p>We tried some &#8216;virtual reality&#8217;, which was named in the most generous
  sense of the word.  Really it was a plastic massage chair that shook
  while you watched a scary point-of-view vignette that was loosely
  based on Jurassic park.  Rodney gripped the metal handles as he yelled
  out, &#8220;DADAA LOOK DINOSAUR&#8221;.</p>
<p>We finished off the evening by spending some hard earned points at the
  gift shop.  Despite the walls being filled with prizing and us having
  a good amount of points to spend, Rodney went straight for a small
  D&amp;B&#8217;s kickball and held it to his side, giving me a look that said
  &#8220;OK, I&#8217;m good.&#8221;  I had to encourage him to wander a bit and spend the
  rest of his points.  We got a sticky hand, a Chinese finger trap, a
  ring pop, and a pink bracelet for mom.</p>
<p>After Marissa put Rodney to bed, I snuck into his room for a quick
  hug.  I tucked him in as he offered me one final sleepy thanks.  <i>Desa
  dadda play games</i>.  As few words as possible, but it got the point
  across, and it warms my heart just recounting it.</p>
<p>Marissa and I spent the rest of the night catching up on chores,
  taking a small break to eat on some french toast and plan some
  Christmas shopping.  We wrapped up chores sometime after eleven and
  caught up on YouTube videos.  I made the fatal mistake of eating one
  to many sport peppers out of the jar, which is why I&#8217;m hesitant to
  blame D&amp;B&#8217;s for this morning&#8217;s indigestion.  Either way, this is
  self-inflicted.</p>
<p>Today should be a nice quiet day of work, and after work, I&#8217;m really
  craving something that will break the junk food streak.  Tonight we
  might be having mashed potatoes, some steamed vegetables, and maybe a
  chicken breast.  And no sport peppers are going near it.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful day today.</p>
