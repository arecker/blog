<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Happy Friday to you, reader.  Wasn&#8217;t the rain
  beautiful last night?  By us, the gentle thunder continued into most
  of the night, providing a great soundtrack for evening work and
  relaxation.  However, not everyone enjoyed the rain.  Rodney had
  trouble falling asleep, being scared of the thunder.  Marissa gave him
  a quick snuggle and tucked him in, assuring him that the noises
  outside were just like music.  After Marissa went back into her
  studio, I heard his quiet voice sleepily repeat &#8220;it&#8217;s music&#8221; just a
  few more times before drifting off for the night.  Mom&#8217;s are the best,
  aren&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty busy work day, but I got my work done, and in
  the last thirty minutes of the day instead of attending Thursday&#8217;s
  happy hour on the lower floor, I prepared to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2LyD3sNegE">bulgogi</a>.  I watched
  the video a few times, made a grocery list, and planned out the
  timeline.  The recipe involved making a marinade from grated onions,
  garlic, ginger, brown sugar, pears, and hot pepper paste, then using
  the mixture to soak and soften thin strips of beef for exactly one
  hour - a difficult feat for a weeknight meal.  On the bus ride home, I
  sent Marissa a slack message warning her that I would be moving pretty
  fast when I got home, sacrificing the usual five minutes I take to put
  my stuff down and play with the dogs while we catch up.</p>
<p>At 4:58 PM, I walked in the door and trotted upstairs to wake Rodney
  up.  He was in a deep nap, and a little groggy, but I told him we were
  going to Hy-Vee and he rallied.  These days, he likes taking his large
  giant stuffed giraffe on our grocery store trips, which isn&#8217;t nearly
  as distracting as you might think.</p>
<p>Rodney, Giraffe, and I hit the road and got to Hy-Vee at 5:15 PM.  We
  made a quick lap around the store picking up what we needed for the
  marinade, and Rodney grabbed some goldfish to snack on as well.
  Rodney is pretty helpful at Hy-Vee - he stays by my side, or sits down
  below on the lip of the cart, sometimes getting up to take direction
  and put things in the basket.  By 5:26 PM, we were heading through the
  parking lot back to the car.</p>
<p>We pulled into the driveway at 5:35 PM.  That gave me about 15 minutes
  before I had to get the beef in the marinade.  Before I even put the
  groceries away, I was grating onion, garlic, and ginger, which gave me
  a good cry, and felt pretty nice.  By 5:45 PM, I started to slice the
  steak, and 5:50 PM the prep was finished, steak happily resting in the
  fridge in a slurry of deliciousness.  I breathed a sigh of relief,
  plopping down on the couch with Marissa and Rod to have our postponed
  daily catch up.</p>
<p>The rest of the bulgogi recipe was pretty simple.  I made some rice,
  then spent the rest of the hour preparing to make a lot of smoke.  The
  recipe calls for searing the strips of beef in cast iron heated to
  literally the hottest temperature your stove can reach.  Marissa
  helped me open up all the windows, and I took the batteries out of the
  smoke detector.</p>
<p>After an hour, while wearing my BBQ heat proof mits, I started to sear
  the beef.  It made a wonderful sound, as a plume of wet delicious
  steam billowed toward the ceiling.  I did my best to sear each piece
  for two minutes per side, but I overcrowded the pan just a bit, so I
  did my best.  Dinner was ready by 7 PM on the dot, and even though I
  didn&#8217;t get nearly as much delicious brown crust as I would have liked,
  there was enough to prove the recipe worked - a great home recipe
  peeking through a minor setback.  And even though the timing was just
  a bit too tight for a weekday dinner, there&#8217;s always the weekend.
  Next time, I&#8217;ll try marinating the beef for longer and searing the
  strips in smaller batches.</p>
<p>After dinner, Marissa spent time in the studio painting, and I hacked
  a bit on my blog.  I added a &#8220;streak calculator&#8221; to the home page,
  which measures how many consecutive days I&#8217;ve made a journal entry.  I
  also re enabled my RSS feed, which was a bit startling because the
  automation started spamming my twitter and slack, spuriously sending
  out updates for every entry I&#8217;ve made in the last week.</p>
<p>Today will be kind of a strange day.  I scheduled some vacation time
  for the second half of the work day, planning on heading to Chicago
  with Marissa for a party, but Marissa is not feeling well, so we
  cancelled.  But the whole thing happened pretty recently, and I didn&#8217;t
  have time to remove my PTO entry, so I&#8217;m still going to take a half
  day off.  And that&#8217;s fine, I had a pretty busy week of work, and I&#8217;ll
  happily use the time to walk somewhere with Marissa and Rod and enjoy
  the afternoon.</p>
<p>Hope you have a wonderful day today.  Remember, thunderstorms are just
  like music, and open all the windows in your house before making
  Korean BBQ beef.</p>
