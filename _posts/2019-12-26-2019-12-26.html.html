excerpt: naps, nvg's, bowling, and fried plastic

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you all had a wonderful and relaxing
  holiday.  Our Christmas morning yielded good gifts, good food, and
  great naps.  Isn&#8217;t it funny how little of the day Christmas morning
  actually takes up?  After Marissa and I spent all morning preparing
  gifts and a delicious breakfast all to give Rodney that magical
  <i>coming down the stairs on Christmas morning</i> sensation, it&#8217;s funny
  how suddenly you don&#8217;t know what to do with yourself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christmas is a weird day,&#8221; I said to Marissa.  We were both up in our
  bedroom putting things away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that about Christmas - it&#8217;s the best day of the year,&#8221;
  Marissa said.  I could tell that I had unintentionally slighted her
  favorite holiday, and I reeled to clarify my stance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, I&#8217;m not a Christmas hater -&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a Christmas hater.  You hate Christmas.&#8221;  Marissa stood
  squarely at her closet door, interrupting me to emphasize her point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a weird day - that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m saying,&#8221; I sheepishly
  continued.  &#8220;For an hour in the morning, our house feels like a Norman
  Rockwell painting, but then afterwards, what do we do with ourselves?
  It&#8217;s a whole day!&#8221;  Marissa finally smirked.  &#8220;Did you know that while
  you were napping, I put my apron on and then just paced around looking
  for things to do?&#8221;  I said, my voice growing louder.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a weird day, I&#8217;ll give you that,&#8221; Marissa nodded.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s true - while Marissa slept on the couch, I put my apron on
  and looked for things to put away.  After Marissa woke, I took a three
  hour nap, and at the end of it all the three of us were vaguely
  rested, yet groggy, and hungry, yet full.  We were on the fence about
  how to spend our evening.  We thought about seeing a movie, but the
  only viable choice in theaters was <i>Spies in Disguise</i> - which to be
  frank, sitting through an animated movie where Will Smith voices a
  talking pigeon sounded worse than Chinese water torture.  &#8220;We could go
  bowling,&#8221; I suggested.  Marissa shrugged her shoulders agreeably, and
  Rodney overhearing the suggestion began to jump up and down.  &#8220;Bowling
  bowling bowling,&#8221; he cried as he bounced around the living room.</p>
<p>We prepared to leave, and as Rodney was putting his shoes on, he made
  it clear he was bringing his &#8220;NVG&#8217;s&#8221;.  The play tools set we bought -
  ahem - <i>santa brought</i> him for Christmas included some goggles, and
  Rodney assumed they were night vision goggles.  <i>NVG&#8217;s</i> for short.</p>
<p>We drove to Dream Lanes on the east side.  We ordered a pizza, I got a
  beer, and we all bowled terribly.  Rodney beat Marissa and I by at
  least thirty points, but he had bumpers and a metal ramp to guide the
  ball into the middle of the pins.  As Marissa and I alternated helping
  him bowl, I jokingly lined up the metal ramp with the gutter and said,
  &#8220;alright Rod, we&#8217;re gonna try a new technique here.&#8221;  Marissa - or
  <i>Prison Mike</i> if we&#8217;re going to use her bowling scoreboard alias,
  cackled behind us.</p>
<p>We returned home and put Rodney to bed.  Then suddenly feeling
  energized from all the napping and extra sleep accumulated from the
  day off, I decided to redo my IT shelf.  I ripped all the parts off
  the wall and got to assembling my new mini ITX case I got for my
  router.  I hit a few snags.  As these things usually work out, the
  back panel obstructed half the plugs behind the motherboard, and with
  Marissa&#8217;s help, we had to cut the metal.  Marissa&#8217;s natural
  craftsmanship took over, and not wanting to leave shoddy work to her
  name, she took extra time to bend the jagged edges and round them off.</p>
<p>With the motherboard and loose SSD buttoned up in a case, I
  reassembled my shelf.  This time around, the cable management
  clicked.  I was more patient this time around, and while wrapping
  cables in velcro, it suddenly occurred to me that good cable
  management is a lot like training vines in a garden.  You can&#8217;t bend
  <i>every</i> cable to your will, and sometimes it works out if you first
  see where each cable wants to lie before securing it.</p>
<p>Feeling much better about the arrangement, it was finally time to hit
  the big red switch on my surge protector.  The wall whirred to life,
  but then suddenly I heard a fizz and a pop behind the Charter modem.
  Upon further inspection, I had accidentally switched the power cables
  between the modem and my switch.  While my switch seemed to adapt
  fine, the unexpected difference in voltage appeared to fry my modem.
  As irony would have it everything about my home network worked
  perfectly, only there was no Internet.  I fished the fried modem out
  of the wall and brought it to Marissa.  &#8220;It even kind of smells like
  fried plastic,&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>So with no connection to the outside world, Marissa and I spent the
  rest of the night listening to music, and I even played some Splinter
  Cell on the couch.  You can do more without Internet than I remember.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re barreling down the high way blaring Rodney&#8217;s
  favorite car CD, bound for Minnesota.  We&#8217;re beginning the second half
  of our holiday duties, this time visiting Marissa&#8217;s family.  At this
  point, it&#8217;s hard to tell if we&#8217;re tired from too much sleep or not
  quite enough.  I&#8217;m holding out in hope that after getting some fast
  food and a crisp diet coke, I&#8217;ll perk up and be ready to mingle with
  more extended family.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re up to today.  I still hold by my stance that
  Christmas is a weird day.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong - it&#8217;s great, but at
  some point I find rhythm and routine more relaxing than a sudden bing
  of presents and rest.  But I don&#8217;t think that makes me a Christmas
  hater.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a wonderful post Christmas, whatever that means
  for you.  If you have no plans, and you suddenly find yourself pacing
  around your house looking for something to do, allow me to recommend
  bowling.  That just might be a new Recker family Christmas tradition.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and have a wonderful day.</p>
