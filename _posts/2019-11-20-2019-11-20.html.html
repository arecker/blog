<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re feeling good this morning.  I
  woke up with just a touch of queasiness, and I&#8217;m not sure where it
  came from.  After eating a bloomin&#8217; onion on Sunday and going a bit
  hog-wild at D&amp;B&#8217;s on Monday, I intentionally tried to take things easy
  yesterday, but I did reward my efforts with a bag of popcorn.  Who
  knows what I&#8217;m working through right now.  In between the sentences of
  this paragraph, I nibbled on a stroopwaffel, and I&#8217;m already starting
  to feel better.  Maybe I just needed something to coat my stomach.</p>
<p>Sip.  Yesterday was a pretty good day.  I had a quiet day reading and
  working on things, wandering around the office and setting up shop at
  different soft spaces.  Lately my favorite place to work is the
  seventh floor in the cafeteria.  The broad windows overlook the corner
  of the city square, and the capital dominates the scenery.  Even on
  gloomy days, it&#8217;s still inspirational to see the capital standing
  strong through it all.  Not to mention, it looks pretty great when
  it&#8217;s dusted with snow.  The ninth floor cafeteria has the same effect,
  but being higher up the building, it tends to be a little more popular
  for sight seeing.  Working on the seventh floor also minimizes
  distractions and interruptions, since it&#8217;s all salespeople and
  marketing.</p>
<p>As I was working, someone sent me a document around conducting code
  screens for internship candidates.  I perked up, and immediately
  shifted my attention to reading and commenting.  It mildly derailed
  what I was already working on, but interviews and code screens are one
  of those things which I have a lot of opinions around, and lately at
  work I&#8217;m trying to get better at disseminating my opinion.  I left
  comments, but not too in excess.  Something else I also spoke with my
  boss about was the importance of letting people make their own
  mistakes.  Not to say that you should treat everyone around you like a
  bunch of screw-ups.  Just keep in mind that no matter what you tell
  people, they will always trust their own experiences more, so if you
  meet resistance and you don&#8217;t want the rest of your feedback to fall
  on deaf ears, just let it go.</p>
<p>Against my better judgment, I finished the day by attending a meeting
  that I totally forgot about.  I didn&#8217;t even remember why I was there.
  I usually skip those meetings, because I don&#8217;t like to just roll up to
  a meeting and be a warm body in the corner, but I don&#8217;t like to be a
  complete intellectual burden on everybody and make everyone bring me
  up to speed.  I read somewhere that there is never an excuse for
  boredom in a meeting.  Instead, you should either be a source of
  energy, or you should leave - which is kind of a corporate jedi
  mind-trick spin on &#8220;I left because I was bored.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;m in a corporate wisdom mood this morning.  Usually I don&#8217;t
  gravitate to that kind of subject matter.  Maybe whatever is festering
  in my stomach has also reached my brain and has started pulling cables
  that normally don&#8217;t get any action.  Wait - yep - there it is.  I
  suddenly have the urge to make a Pinterest page.  I feel like buying
  nick-nacks on etsy.  I feel like golf - not playing golf, just
  watching it on TV.</p>
<p>I kid, but sometimes I think of how fragile a personality is, and I
  think about Phineas Gage - that horrible story about that railroad
  worker who accidentally got a spike in his head.  And he became
  famous - not for surviving the accident - but for becoming a total
  crab afterwards.  It&#8217;s one of those stories that somehow made it into
  every elementary school history book, as if Phineas Gage was one of
  America&#8217;s founding fathers.  In our home life, the story of Phineas
  Gage lives on as a joke between me and Marissa - usually when one of
  us is making the other <i>shlep</i> things around the house.  Marissa will
  hand me something sharp, or difficult to store and carry, then out of
  a sense of conscientiousness add, &#8220;&#8230; and don&#8217;t <i>Phineas Gage</i> me
  with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>After work, we all went to Hy-Vee to pick up some groceries.  Marissa
  tagged along to mail some packages, and I leveraged her availability
  to also pick me up a new 10-ride.  The Hy-Vee counter is convenient,
  but risky if you are trying to get in and out of the store very
  quickly. Sometimes there is no wait at all, and the person behind the
  counter greets you warmly with pride and professionalism, and the
  transaction is over so fast that Rodney didn&#8217;t even have time to find
  something to spill on the floor.  Other times, there are numerous
  people in line, and the person at the counter is sweating through
  their red polo trying to answer two phone lines while arguing with
  some weirdo trying to return juice because <i>it&#8217;s defective</i>.</p>
<p>Marissa joined us later in the store, somewhere around the milk aisle.
  We checked out, then I started dinner as soon as we got home.  In the
  spirit of breaking the weekend junk food cycle, I cooked two chicken
  breasts with some baked brussel&#8217;s sprouts and mashed potatoes.
  Despite all the practice I&#8217;ve had in the kitchen, I still get
  raw-chicken paranoia.  As we sat down to eat, I didn&#8217;t feel certain
  about it until I sliced and inspected every piece of chicken on the
  plate.  I even popped some of them in the microwave.  What is the
  remedy for raw chicken paranoia?  Maybe I need to spend a month
  meditating about the randomness in the universe with a bunch of monks
  in the mountains.  Maybe I need to get salmonella just once.</p>
<p>After dinner, Rodney, Marissa and I played a game of Jenga as we
  enjoyed a bowl of ice cream.  Rodney is now skillful enough to hold
  his own, although we never let it get competitive.  &#8220;It&#8217;s communist
  Jenga,&#8221; I joked.  &#8220;Whether the tower gets higher or crumbles, we
  distribute the pride and blame equally.&#8221;  Neither of us are
  competitive people, and we&#8217;d prefer to keep it that way.  Life already
  pretty complicated, and sometimes you just want to check out, eat some
  ice cream and play Jenga with your toddler without having to explain
  why people who like each other sometimes try to beat each other at
  things that don&#8217;t matter in the long run.</p>
<p>After putting Rodney to bed, I talked to my dad on the phone for a
  bit.  About two days ago, he extended an invite to go to a tailgate
  and a Bears game, and everything just fell into place.  We had some
  more details to figure out before he turned in for the night.  &#8220;You
  guys have almost the same bedtime as Rodney,&#8221; I teased.  So December
  5th, it looks like I&#8217;ll be attending my first NFL game at beautiful
  Soldier Field, and though I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re going to get murdered by the
  Cowboys and publicly humiliated with some kind of coaching blunder,
  I&#8217;m excited to have the opportunity to share in the live saltiness
  with other bitter, like-minded Bears fans.  And what a way to cap off
  my first season as - I like how my dad put it - &#8220;[someone] who is
  suddenly and inexplicably fascinated with the Bears.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hope you have a great day, everyone.  To sum up, leave meetings when
  you&#8217;re bored, commemorate Phineas Gage when shlepping things for your
  spouse, and work as a team when you play Jenga.</p>
