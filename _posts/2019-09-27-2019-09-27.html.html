<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Happy Friday.  This morning it&#8217;s dark outside.
  Kind of eerie, kind of cozy.  The ominous clouds and cool air are
  pretty cool to wake up to.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a busy day.  If you do them right, Thursdays should be
  busy.  It&#8217;s really the gauntlet you have to run before the weekend.
  In the morning I wrapped up some code I was working on and shoved it
  out to our staging environment.  I grabbed a chicken wrap from a food
  cart, then hung out on the seventh floor while I made a lesson plan
  for kids code.  I riffed on some educational stuff about phishing
  attacks, then put together a little tutorial for building your own
  nefarious login page.  I went for a short walk around the square, then
  I did some more research stuff for a project we&#8217;re starting next week.
  By four o&#8217;clock, I had finished a pretty dense &amp; productive work day,
  but it wasn&#8217;t over yet.  I jumped on a bus and got home around five,
  having about a half hour to hang around the house before I had to
  leave to set up for Kids Code.  Marissa was working on a painting
  outside, so we sat together on the deck.  I grabbed a bag of kettle
  corn to tide me over until dinner.  We caught up, I got Rod up from
  his nap, then I trotted over to the library to set up.</p>
<p>Our Kids Code session went really well.  We had a great turnout, and
  even though nobody worked on the <i>DIY phishing scam</i> I planned, we
  still had a great time working on scratch games.  In hindsight, young
  kids probably don&#8217;t come across phishing scams as often.  It occurred
  to me that kids don&#8217;t have any credit cards, and if you don&#8217;t have any
  credit, there&#8217;s no reason for a scammer to be interested.  On top of
  that, spam filters are generally pretty advanced now.  Back when I
  first got an email, all that stuff used to actually make it to my
  inbox, and I had to read the message and determine for myself if it
  was from a scammer.  All in all, the kids probably had no idea what I
  was talking about.</p>
<p>As we were packing up, I got a notification from my phone that an
  event called &#8220;Take a Nap&#8221; was starting in ten minutes.  I chuckled,
  remembering how tired I was when I made the event that morning.  Funny
  story, I didn&#8217;t actually take a nap.  I was pretty wired from the busy
  day, so instead I walked to taco bell to pick up a late dinner, then
  ate it on the couch with the dogs and watched YouTube videos.
  Sometimes &#8220;me time&#8221; is just as relaxing as a nap, if not even more
  relaxing.  For me, taco bell especially is the ultimate indulgence.
  Eating taco bell is completely unconscious.  Chewing the hot cheese
  and buttery tortilla just empties my brain, and it turns into this
  weird, gluttonous form of meditation.</p>
<p>Side note: if you&#8217;re wondering, the correct way to eat taco bell is to
  let it get cold in the fridge, then microwave it in the wrapper until
  it&#8217;s pretty much melted into itself.  It&#8217;s like a completely different
  meal.</p>
<p>After eating, I grabbed my laptop and hacked a bit on my website code.
  I finished breaking out some of the statistics.  Word count now
  accounts for both public &amp; private posts, as do &#8220;streaks&#8221; and &#8220;dry
  spells&#8221;.  But now that all the data is there, I think it looks too
  busy, and sometime this weekend I&#8217;m probably going to move things
  around again.</p>
<p>So back to here.  Friday morning, sitting in the dark drinking a now
  cold cup of coffee.  Right now, I&#8217;m feeling pretty content.  This
  weekend is just a lot of hanging out, relaxing, coding, cooking, and
  I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb and assume I&#8217;m getting one or two neat
  birthday presents this weekend.  I think it&#8217;s going to be a good
  weekend.  Ah, and next week is wedding week!  My little sister is
  getting married.  All that rigamarole begins for us on Thursday, so I
  even get a shorter work week out of it too.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful Friday, and a wonderful weekend.  Hope
  you spend time relaxing, whether that&#8217;s taking naps or eating taco
  bell in front of the TV.  You do you.  Thanks for reading.</p>
