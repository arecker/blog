excerpt: computers, naps, and work

<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, and hope you&#8217;re doing well on this drizzly morning.  We
  had some nice summer thunderstorms roll in last night.  Ziggy and I
  took a spontaneous nap on the couch while listening to the thunder.
  Sometimes in the evening, especially during weeks where I don&#8217;t get as
  much sleep as I&#8217;d like to, I&#8217;ll take a quick power nap on the couch
  with Ziggy.  Her nose gets cold, and she likes to tuck her head
  between my head and the pillow, and a few minutes of listening to her
  breath will effectively lull me to sleep.</p>
<p>After a quick power nap, I dragged up the downstairs computer and
  opened it up.  My goal was to just have a quick look, maybe remove
  some dust, then put it back, but the project kind of spun out of
  control and before I knew it, I had all the parts completely removed
  and set aside.  There&#8217;s a lot more going on than I anticipated.  As I
  had feared, the power supply is a giant, hideous gray box.  But it
  just occurred to me that if I could boot it without the video card, I
  might be able to get away with a smaller, more low profile power
  supply - and that&#8217;s better for our electric bill as well.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, it was 10:45, so I rushed to re assemble the
  computer before evening TV time.  The computer booted, but there was
  no video output - thanks to my brilliant strategy of not taking
  pictures or notes and just winging it.  On the bright side, now that
  the computer is only half assembled, it should be much easier to pick
  up where I left off tonight.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking about just selling off the parts individually and buying
  a low powered Atom board.  I&#8217;m kind of over the whole &#8220;beefy computer&#8221;
  thing.  This past year has been an unofficial experiment in cheap, low
  powered machines, and for the most part they all have worked out
  pretty well.  The only time I have trouble is running chrome on my
  raspberry pi, but I try to do that sparingly.  I can still take notes,
  make journal entries, and even write some code without having to open
  up a browser.  I would also tout the electric savings, but I&#8217;m sure my
  desktop and servers are a drop in the bucket compared to what it costs
  to run our AC in the hot summer months.  We like to keep it cold - I
  like when every room in the house feels like a chilly basement.</p>
<p>So what else is going on&#8230; the interns and I have started on the
  second to last week of work, and it&#8217;s a doozy.  Last week we rehearsed
  the disaster recovery plan and designed some ambitious improvements,
  and this is the week where we pretty much just attempt to build
  everything.  As always, they&#8217;re way further along than I anticipated,
  but overall it should be the perfect amount of work for the last two
  weeks we have together.</p>
<p>Hope you all have a wonderful Tuesday.  When was the last time you
  cleaned the dust out of your computer?  I bet it looks like coral reef
  of dust bunnies in there.</p>
