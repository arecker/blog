<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Hope you&#8217;re feeling good today.  Rodney and I
  have been up for a little over an hour now, and it&#8217;s been a slow ramp
  up for both of us.  He&#8217;s still getting over his cold, and I guess from
  taking such a long nap yesterday he&#8217;s up early, and was feeling
  cranky.  But after a some milk and a couple episodes of Blippi - and a
  couple cups of coffee for me - we&#8217;re both getting there, and it&#8217;s
  starting to feel like a regular Saturday morning.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty groggy from yesterday.  After putting Rodney to bed, I
  crashed on the couch under a blanket with Ziggy close by.  The next
  thing I remember was Marissa shaking me sometime around eleven, asking
  me if I wanted a grapefruit.  I sat up, and we watched some TV while
  we ate, before finally heading upstairs again around midnight.  It
  felt great to get some extra sleep, but now all I want to do is keep
  sleeping, so this morning I&#8217;m just trying to build some momentum and
  have a productive day.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty great day.  There was a small shake-up at work
  in the morning when some construction on another floor accidentally
  set off the fire alarm.  My work hadn&#8217;t sent any emails about a fire
  drill, so after we all filed down the stairwell and out to the capitol
  building lawn, my team stood around and postulated about what could
  have triggered it.  &#8220;You know I heard on NPR that buildings are so
  safe these days that the average firefighter only sees one actual fire
  per year,&#8221; said my teammate.  Standing around with my team, I noticed
  that I absent-mindedly carried my coffee mug down the stairs and
  outside with me, filled to the brim with warm coffee.  I&#8217;m so used to
  carrying my Seinfeld mug with me wherever I go, it&#8217;s hard to break the
  habit even in an emergency evacuation.  But it was pretty chilly, and
  it took at least ten minutes for the fire department to shut off the
  tripped alarm, so I must have looked pretty smart to some people,
  comfortably sipping hot coffee outside.</p>
<p>They gave us the all clear, and we all groaned knowing that we would
  now have to now climb eight flights of stairs back up to our floor.
  &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be an hour late to stand-up,&#8221; I announced to my team.
  &#8220;I&#8217;m going to wait for the elevator.&#8221;  Eyes rolled.</p>
<p>After ascending the stairs, we stood around by our stand-up spot
  catching our breath.  I started fiddling with a pack of Hubba Bubba
  that I bought and contribute to our common gum &amp; mints stash.  &#8220;You
  should put the whole thing in your mouth,&#8221; said my team lead.  The
  others nodded in approval.  I shrugged, then slipped the whole roll of
  Hubba Bubba in my mouth and started chewing.  &#8220;By the end of this
  stand-up meeting,&#8221; I said through gum &amp; drool, &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna blow a
  bubble just watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I did blow a bubble - a tiny one.  Hubba Bubba is a pretty
  terrible gum all around.  It&#8217;s chalky, it loses it&#8217;s flavor
  immediately, and it falls apart in your mouth.  I don&#8217;t know how I
  ended up being the guy that does things just because people dare me
  to, but I like the street cred.  I&#8217;m reminded of the time I ate a
  whole wad of wasabi of somebody&#8217;s plate during a team sushi lunch.  No
  doubt, there has to be some middle child psychology at play.</p>
<p>The rest of the work day was pretty normal.  I worked through the
  morning, then took a break around 11 to heat up my soup and eat it at
  a spot at the 7th floor bar overlooking the capital.  I career
  highlights of Brian Urlacher from my phone.  Brian Urlacher was a
  scary guy, wasn&#8217;t he?  It&#8217;s terrifying how fast he could move for how
  big he is.</p>
<p>As the work day concluded, we all met back at our section to pack our
  desks.  Next week, they&#8217;re moving us down to the sixth floor of the
  building.  Just before heading home, we took a walk around where we&#8217;d
  be sitting.  I think I came out pretty lucky in this desk move.  I
  have a nice quiet corner seat overlooking the lake, and it feels much
  closer to the ground, which is pretty cozy.</p>
<p>After getting home, I made a pizza, and we ate it at the table.  Rod
  had just woken up from a monster nap, so he was groggy and a little
  grumpy.  &#8220;You know,&#8221; my wife spoke up.  &#8220;Rod and I had an idea today,
  Dad.&#8221;  Rodney stopped chewing and widened his eyes in anticipation.
  &#8220;We wanted to know if we could go get a chocolate shake, then go check
  out the Christmas lights on John Nolan,&#8221; she continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chrimbiss Lights?!&#8221; Rodney exclaimed.</p>
<p>I paused and furrowed my brow, pretending to deliberate.  &#8220;Well&#8230; I
  suppose so.  But we better leave now.&#8221;</p>
<p>We all packed in the car, dogs included, then after stopping by
  Portillo&#8217;s for some late night shakes, we continued driving to the
  John Nolan park.  As we crossed the lake, we could already see a big
  cluster of colorful Christmas lights coming into view.  We inched the
  car slowly through a giant lit tunnel, which started to flicker and
  change colors.  There was a fighter jet, giant football helmet,
  dancing Bucky the Badger, and a big bulldozer driven by Santa all made
  up by colorful Christmas lights.  The last installation was a replica
  of the Madison capitol.  It made me laugh, because the Christmas
  lights version sort of just looked like a stubby summer sausage stuck
  into some glowing blocks, and it looked even sillier because it stood
  in front of the actual capitol building well visible from across the
  lake.  We took at least three more laps around the Christmas lights,
  then went home.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what I got today.  Yesterday, after getting back, I
  basically got right to recharging.  I spent the rest of the night
  passed out on the couch under some blankets, and between you and me, I
  plan on doing some more of that today.  After of course I clean up
  from yesterday&#8217;s pizza.</p>
<p>Hope you have a wonderful day, and a restful weekend.  Next week is
  the last week before Christmas, so if you&#8217;re like me and you&#8217;ll be
  doing a lot of last minute planning, gifting, and driving, I&#8217;d get as
  much rest as possible this weekend.  Thanks for reading, and happy
  Saturday!</p>
