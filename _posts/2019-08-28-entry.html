<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  Happy Wednesday.  I&#8217;m coming to you today from
  home a little later than usual.  Marissa and I stayed up late watching
  the Handmaid&#8217;s Tale, then even later to do laundry, so I appreciated
  the extra forty-five minutes of sleep.  In a few moments, I&#8217;ll wake
  her up to go to agility class with Ziggy and Ollie while the Rod man
  and I hold it down here at home.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  I got some good work done in the
  morning, then heated up my cheese steak for lunch.  It&#8217;s funny how
  when they&#8217;re reheated, the smell vaguely reminds me of a microwaved
  cheeseburger from McDonald&#8217;s.  I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s no coincidence, there
  must be some crossover in how they&#8217;re made.  Or maybe they&#8217;re just
  both greasy, beefy guilty pleasures.</p>
<p>I continued working after lunch and finished pretty much everything I
  had for the day around three, so I started thinking about what to make
  for dinner.  Marissa had just ordered a big bag of this special brand
  of white rice, going off of a recommendation from somebody we met in
  Vancouver.  So after chatting on slack, we decided to go with salmon,
  asparagus, and of course, white rice.</p>
<p>After getting home around five, I got Rod in the car to go to Hy-Vee.
  He was in a pretty bad mood yesterday.  Usually he&#8217;s very chatty on
  the way to the grocery store, but yesterday he just sat and quietly
  muttered to himself.  At one point, he asked me something about
  airplanes, but lost his patience with me when I couldn&#8217;t figure out
  what he was saying.  I think he&#8217;s finally picking up on my standard
  phrases I use as filler when there is a breakdown in adult-toddler
  communication.  &#8220;Yeah dude, airplanes?  They ARE awesome.&#8221;  I can&#8217;t
  blame him, that is a little condescending, isn&#8217;t it?  Can you imagine
  talking to someone with a thick accent or who was new to English, and
  just responding to them, &#8220;Yeah dude, AIRPLANES?  Awesome!  Thumbs
  up!&#8221;.</p>
<p>When we got home, Rod helped me put some of the groceries away, then I
  started on dinner.  To my great relief, the instructions for making
  rice were right on the side of the bag, so I didn&#8217;t need to slog
  through those crummy overly personal food blogs to find a consistent
  formula.  Making rice has always felt so tedious to me - the rinsing,
  the very specific proportions that differ per type and grain size, the
  timing.  I&#8217;ve committed to learning it, being a pretty fundamental
  ingredient to a lot of other dishes, but I cook things that I enjoy
  and it goes without saying why I don&#8217;t cook rice very much.</p>
<p>This recipe was pretty straight forward.  Just 1 cup of rice, 1.5 cups
  of water, simmer for ten twenty minutes covered, off the heat covered
  for twenty minutes, then &#8220;fluff&#8221; with a fork.  Oh, how fancy for you
  rice!  I get to fluff you with a fork.  In the time and dirty dishes
  it took to make you, I probably could made a whole batch of philly
  cheese steaks.  Excuse my hostility here, I clearly have some personal
  issues with rice.  Many failed attempts will do that.</p>
<p>After appeasing the fickle gods of rice cooking, I grilled some
  salmon, blanched some asparagus, then - just for the hell of it - I
  cut up a french loaf and toasted the pieces on the grill.  We ate
  dinner on the deck and admired the swarms of mayflies that had just
  spawned and manifested in our backyard.  I didn&#8217;t know about these
  bugs, but they&#8217;re a big thing up here.  They spawn twice in the
  summer, and even though they look just like mosquitos, they don&#8217;t
  bite.  And when they spawn, they&#8217;re still pretty week, so all you have
  to do is spray some water on them and they die.  I guess it&#8217;s one of
  those silly little insects that has adapted for survival with quantity
  over quality.</p>
<p>After dinner, I put Rodney to bed while Marissa folded his laundry.
  We read some new Spider-Man children&#8217;s books that arrived in the mail
  that day.  Reading time turned into improv time as I started doing
  voices and sound effects for the spider-man story.  You just can&#8217;t
  read for the Green Goblin unless you&#8217;re going to be over the top.</p>
<p>After Rodney went to bed, I decided to re roll my bedroom computer
  before starting on chores.  I was doing a very minimal &#8216;terminal only&#8217;
  thing for the past two weeks, but I decided I missed my desktop, and
  especially my beloved pong screensaver.  Have I told you about my pong
  screensaver?  It&#8217;s a classic game of pong, only the score is matched
  up to the hour and minute of a clock.  As a result, the paddle on the
  right (team minute hand) ends up just destroying the paddle on the
  left.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s time to get going.  Hope you all have a wonderful day
  today.  Happy Wednesday, friends.</p>
