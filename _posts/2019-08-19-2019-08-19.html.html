<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning to everyone, and happy Monday!  Marissa and I are heading
  into a long stint of busy weekends.  The theme of this weekend was
  definitely &#8220;rest while you can&#8221;.  We did as little as possible, taking
  every chance we could to sit on the couch as a family and keep a low
  profile.  It was definitely relaxing, but the <i>Sunday scaries</i> were
  palpable, and not even just on Sunday.</p>
<p>We squeezed a lot of time out of this weekend to play Minecraft.  It&#8217;s
  funny how Marissa and I are already exhibiting different approaches to
  wilderness survival.  I&#8217;m sleeping on a bed in the middle of a random
  island and spending most of my time in my mine, where I&#8217;ve just kind
  of dropped things where they&#8217;re most practical and have opted to take
  care of the aesthetics later.  Last night I wandered over to Marissa&#8217;s
  house, where it seems she&#8217;s going with the opposite approach.  There&#8217;s
  a giant winding staircase that leads far into the sky to a platform.
  Sure, not as practical, but a hell of a view.</p>
<p>I also caught some time to clean up the plex server.  I combed over my
  movie collection and fixed up some misnamed files.  I couldn&#8217;t be more
  pleased with the new file server.  On Friday, I spun everything down
  and added two more drives into the storage pool.  To free up USB
  ports, I had to move the boot drive, and for the most part everything
  was perfectly in tact when it powered back up.  Next time I get a
  chance, I&#8217;m going to set up both the router &amp; file server to
  automatically reboot something like once a week at three in the
  morning.  Even though a good system shouldn&#8217;t need frequent reboots,
  it&#8217;s a good way to ensure everything is correctly configured and
  self-healing, and that especially comes in handy with unexpected
  reboots, like power outages.</p>
<p>Also did a bit of cooking this week.  I made carbonara last night,
  which was a luxurious pasta made with egg, grated cheese, and
  pancietta, but I made the fatal flaw of over-salting the pasta water.
  Combined with the salty pork, the whole thing just tasted like a
  sodium party.  I packed up some for my lunch today, but I think my
  fingers are still swollen from yesterday&#8217;s portion, I may just be
  eating out for lunch today.</p>
<p>In my defense, there are way too many videos encouraging you to make
  pasta water &#8220;taste like the ocean&#8221;, but not nearly enough videos
  warning you about over-salting.  Which is especially a problem if you
  use the pasta water in the sauce.  Because this has happened a few
  times already, I need to find time come up with my own formula for a
  balanced salt-to-water ratio.  Currently my process involves me adding
  salt incrementally to a big pot of water, stirring and awkwardly
  lapping it with a spoon to check for flavor.  I haven&#8217;t tasted the
  ocean in a while, maybe my reference point is just a little out of
  date.</p>
<p>This week is the intern&#8217;s final week, so I have a lot of planning and
  coordinating to do to transition them out of the summer program.
  We&#8217;re also going to have them over at the end of the week for a pizza
  party.  As a joke, I adapted the term &#8220;pizza party&#8221; at the beginning
  of the internship as kind of a vacuous promise for them getting their
  work done, so I thought it would be funny if I actually threw one for
  them at the end of the year.  This Friday, we&#8217;re going to have them
  over and make a <i>sfincione</i> together.</p>
<p>I was also hit by the realization that I have less than two weeks to
  get everything together for my high school reunion.  I have a few
  dangling email threads full of suggestions, but in the interest of
  time I may just have to start making some decisions.  I&#8217;m sort of glad
  it snuck up on me, to be honest.  It&#8217;s one of those commitments that&#8217;s
  been sort of looming over my head all summer and I&#8217;m partly relieved
  it&#8217;s already here.  Plus, it shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to plan.  It&#8217;s
  just a pot-luck at my high school with a few dozen people.</p>
<p>In case you too have a busy week ahead, I hope you got some <i>you</i> time
  in this weekend.  The hectic end of summer plans are converging right
  in front of us in a perfect storm, but look on the bright side.  At
  least you don&#8217;t have to dread it any more - it&#8217;s already here, and by
  the end of the week, it will be half gone.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful week, everyone.</p>
