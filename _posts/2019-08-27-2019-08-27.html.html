<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning everyone!  I love a weekend as much as the next guy, but
  it felt nice to get back to work yesterday.  It stayed pretty rainy
  and cloudy throughout all the day, which made it really easy to focus
  on getting work done.  We&#8217;re creatures of our environment, aren&#8217;t we?
  It&#8217;s funny how something as simple as the weather can influence how we
  work - even indoors.</p>
<p>For lunch, I went for a quick walk to go take out some cash.  I needed
  bus fare for the ride home, and yesterday morning I had to borrow some
  from Rodney&#8217;s piggy bank.  Later I laughed with Marissa about how
  strange it felt to steal money out of a child&#8217;s piggy bank, taking
  great care not to wake him up with the sound of jangling coins.  I
  imagined I owed money to a bookie, or I was about to go hit a casino.
  But I didn&#8217;t - Rodney knows I&#8217;m good for it.  By the end of the day I
  paid him back with interest.</p>
<p>For lunch, I grabbed a chicken wrap from the Good Food cart.  Their
  name, which really is <i>Good Food</i>, makes it hard to rave about them.
  Can you picture it?  &#8220;Hey that looks pretty good, what are you eating
  Alex?&#8221;  <i>Good Food</i>.  &#8220;Um OK.  Yeah it does look good.&#8221;  But the name
  is literally the only bad thing about the <i>Good Food</i> cart.</p>
<p>After work, I took Rodney to Hy-Vee to pick up stuff for philly cheese
  steaks.  I love the kind of meals that come together from economical
  ingredients.  To my delight, this recipe called for about a pound of
  regular low-end sirloin.  I only had to buy one steak, sandwich rolls,
  and a few other things we like having in the house anyway, like cream
  cheese, kimchi, and a white onion.</p>
<p>When we got home, I put Rodney to work on the buns.  I don&#8217;t think he
  quite grasped that I wanted him to hollow out the inside of the
  sandwich rolls, but he seemed to enjoy himself just moving the bread
  crumbs from one bowl to another.  Meanwhile, I was searing the steak
  in some olive oil, admiring my big stainless steel pan in its element.
  I gave the steak a good sear, then moved in some chopped white onions
  to cook around and under the meat.  After letting the steak cool, I
  cut it up into small pieces and tossed it with the cooked onions,
  cream cheese, kimchi, and shredded provolone.  Rodney was still
  working on the bread crumbs, but he helped himself to plenty of
  shredded provolone right off the cutting board, and I couldn&#8217;t yell at
  him because I do the same.  We stuffed the sandwiches with meat
  filling then topped with more cheese.  They baked for about fifteen
  minutes.  Being a Philly native, I let Ziggy eat the little bit of
  filling left in the mixing bowl.  That&#8217;s only fair, right?</p>
<p>After wolfing down the cheese steak sandwiches, we caught up around
  the dinner table.  Marissa and Rod had a pretty cozy day too.  Marissa
  just got a pretty big art commission for a company in California, so
  she&#8217;s been pretty busy holding it down for Astuary Art.  Rod watched
  TV, played with toys, and read books.</p>
<p>After putting Rod to bed, Marissa worked in the shop a little longer
  and I cleaned up the kitchen before working a bit on the upcoming
  class reunion.  In &#8220;potluck&#8221; style, I made a list of things to bring
  and created a Google form to help people fill it out.  I hadn&#8217;t looked
  at the Google office suite in a while, but my word has it gotten good!
  I was impressed with how well Forms integrates with sheets.  I
  chuckled thinking of all the college assignments I bungled, limping by
  most of my college career on pirated versions of excel, creating
  multiple copies of the same spreadsheet, handing out my dropbox
  password to everyone in my study group.  Seeing all the new web based
  tools available for students almost makes me want to go back and do
  college again.  <i>Almost</i>.</p>
<p>We concluded the evening by finally checking out <i>The Handmaid&#8217;s
  Tale</i>.  We were pretty impressed!  The whole dystopian America thing
  is very creeping, as it&#8217;s compelling.  Over the hour long first
  episode, it was so much fun to mentally piece together the rules of
  their backwards society.  We have two whole seasons to watch, so it
  looks like we&#8217;re going to be busy.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s our time together.  Hope you all have a wonderful Tuesday
  today.  It looks like the weather will be much warmer today, so the
  Fall delusion is over for now.  Today, go for a walk, eat some <i>Good
  Food</i>, and get your work done.</p>
