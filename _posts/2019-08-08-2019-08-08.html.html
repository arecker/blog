<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m struggling this morning.  I woke up with a pretty nasty headache
  right behind one of my eyes.  I just took some Tylenol, and now I&#8217;m
  gulping down coffee in an attempt to get the blood flowing through my
  head.  We&#8217;ll see how I feel in a few minutes, I suppose.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a pretty good day.  It was a really busy work day, so I
  asked Marissa if she wanted to go out to dinner at glass nickel.  We
  usually go there on Wednesdays and it had been a while, so she agreed.
  I ordered the stromboli, and a few minutes after finishing my meal,
  the red sauce and the beer really started to mess with my stomach.
  After we got home, I tried to just work through it and focus on
  cleaning the stove and the microwave, but the indigestion lingered.
  This morning, it must have taken the form of a fun little headache.
  But even while typing this I think it might be dissipating.</p>
<p>Last night, I crawled into bed a little later than I usually do.
  After cleaning the kitchen, I started working on the computer again.
  As planned I removed the video card, then continued to strip the
  computer of any fringe parts that I wouldn&#8217;t need - DVD reader, SD
  card reader, as well as other silly parts and accessories from the
  case.  To my delight, the computer booted - the onboard video card
  worked great, and discarding all that extra plastic and metal was
  gratifying.  I installed freenas on a USB and was having some issues
  getting it to boot before I finally turned in for the night.  At least
  the hardware is done - the next time I pick up this project, it will
  just be a matter of setting up the software.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m thrown off from getting six hours of sleep.  It&#8217;s been a
  while since I&#8217;ve gone to bed this late.  Whatever it is, my energy is
  feeling pretty zapped and I find it bewildering that it&#8217;s only
  Thursday.  If today is not a Friday, then it feels like a ten day
  week.  I think I could just use a good, long nap - that&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m remembering just a few weeks ago when I fell asleep on the boat up
  in Hayward.  We cut the motor, and I reclined on a seat underneath a
  beach towel.  Moments later, I felt like I woke up in a different
  dimension.  To me, that&#8217;s the calling card of a really good nap - you
  wake up feeling completely different than you did when you decided to
  take a nap.  Or how about unplanned naps?  How great are those?
  Earlier this week I plopped onto the couch for a quick snuggle with
  Ziggy, and moments later I awoke feeling refreshed.  I bet if I
  climbed into bed now and slept for three more hours, I&#8217;d have a very
  different morning.  But there&#8217;s no time for sleep.  It&#8217;s Thursday.  We
  got things to do.  I&#8217;m betting after a hot shower and a few more cups
  of coffee, I&#8217;ll blend right into the rest of my chipper, well-rested
  cohorts.</p>
<p>And today should be a regular old Thursday.  I&#8217;ll work, come home,
  take Rodney to Hy-Vee, cook something, then put Rodney to bed.  I have
  some more fiddling to do with the computer, but mark my words, a nap
  on the couch is definitely happening tonight.</p>
<p>You should take a nap too.  Even if you&#8217;re feeling rested, just lay
  your head down and see what happens.  After all, the unplanned naps
  are the best.  Let&#8217;s have a Thursday!</p>
