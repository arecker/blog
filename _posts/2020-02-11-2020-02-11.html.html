<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Tuesday.  I hope you&#8217;re feeling energy
  this morning, staying warm, and staying focused on your goals.  I also
  hope you, like me, have a nice warm cup of coffee to help you keep
  things under control.  Our coffee is hitting me just right this
  morning.  A few days ago I finally got my act together and cleaned our
  coffee maker, using a special packet of <i>descaling agent</i> and general
  cleaning solution that arrived in the mail in tiny white boxes.  &#8220;That
  looks like birth control,&#8221; said Marissa, seeing me rip open the tiny
  white boxes.  She&#8217;s right - one box even had a strip of pink on the
  label, and the other blue.</p>
<p>Now descaled (and added to the monthly chore rotation), it practically
  tastes brand new.  &#8220;I gotta hand it to you,&#8221; I told Marissa.  &#8220;I think
  you are just more sensitive to bad coffee.  I must have a higher
  tolerance for drinking the terrible stuff.&#8221;  And it&#8217;s true - if not
  for her complaining, I would have probably put it off for another
  month, letting our coffee maker get more&#8230; <i>scaley</i>?  In the same
  spirit of things, I&#8217;m trying to stay on top of our water quality.  So
  once a month henceforth, not only will I break out the coffee machine
  birth control, but I will also lug a heavy bag of water softener salt
  down the stairs and dump it into the plastic tank.</p>
<p>Yesterday was a good day.  I worked from home in the morning,
  expecting to help Marissa get the paintings into the freight truck
  sometime in the morning.  But as these things usually work, morning
  passed, lunch passed, and the truck wouldn&#8217;t actually arrive until the
  late afternoon.  But I still appreciated the slow start to the week,
  attending some meetings upstairs from our bedroom and hacking on some
  code in the living room while Rodney played.  For lunch, I scarfed
  down some goulash leftovers standing in the kitchen, eating them right
  out of microwaved tupperware.</p>
<p>This week at work, I&#8217;m kicking off a new project with our tech lead,
  researching some options for putting our team to work in the realm of
  client side secret management.  We&#8217;re also getting ready for some
  visiting higher ups who will want to sit down with our team and hear
  about what we&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p>Around 4, Marissa got a call from UPS saying that the driver would be
  there within the half hour.  I shut my laptop and helped her hoist the
  heavy box out to the driveway.  We stood it up on its side and
  patiently waiting.  Twenty minutes later, she got another call from
  UPS.  I could tell from her end of the phone call that they were
  trying to negotiate postponing the pick-up.  &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I need it
  out today.  I feel like I was pretty generous and flexible, we hung
  around the house all day and I need this thing to head out,&#8221; she said
  sternly.  More chatter proceeded.  &#8220;Is there anything I could have
  done to make this go more smoothly,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Marissa hung up the phone.  &#8220;They wanted to push it a day, I said no,
  and then suddenly two drivers were available to do it,&#8221; she said
  rolling her eyes.  Her phone rang again, and after a brief
  conversation, she hung up and reported, &#8220;he&#8217;s on the beltline, he&#8217;ll
  be here in twenty minutes.&#8221;  I trotted into the house to get the
  football.  With Rodney upstairs sleeping and the dogs waiting
  patiently in their crates, we had a rare opportunity to play a true
  game of outside catch, undisturbed.  Marissa and I laughed as we both
  tried to adjust to the cold and longer throwing range.  &#8220;Our living
  room must be pretty small, it&#8217;s making me look bad,&#8221; I laughed,
  lobbing the ball sloppily toward her feet.  Marissa threw it back - a
  better throw than mine, but skewed slightly toward the grass.  I made
  a over enthusiastic diving catching, landing in the neighbor&#8217;s front
  lawn and rolling into a snowbank.</p>
<p>The UPS truck arrived, and we hoisted the paintings into the truck.
  Marissa recognized the driver from last time she had to ship a big
  painting.  &#8220;We&#8217;re much more prepared this time,&#8221; she said proudly
  patting the box.  After a few last throws of the football, we
  retreated back inside.  Our house felt - and our week - felt lighter
  without the giant box looming over our living room.  &#8220;I feel like I
  can finally close my eyes and rest,&#8221; said Marissa climbing underneath
  a blanket on the couch.  We rested, letting the TV play quietly in the
  living room as the sun went down.  Marissa dozed off, and I hacked on
  some &#8216;fun&#8217; code on my laptop.  Soon, Rodney joined us in the living
  room, contentedly playing with some toy airplanes on the couch between
  us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time to go out to eat?&#8221; I said.  The family stirred, and after
  putting the dogs upstairs and getting bundled up, we jumped in the car
  bound for Glass Nickel, which has been making a comeback lately in the
  lazy eat out portion of our week.  We found a comfortable booth.
  Marissa and I sat at the end, and Rodney scooted all the way down
  towards the wall at the other end of the booth.  Marissa and I smiled,
  amused at his sudden demand for ample personal space.  Rodney busily
  played with his toy planes and drew on his magnet pad, trying to
  forget that we were watching him.</p>
<p>Rodney continued drawing on his magnet pad.  &#8220;Do we have to teach him
  letters?&#8221; said Marissa breaking the silence.  I furrowed my brow and
  shook my head.  &#8220;Nah, that&#8217;s a school thing.  Plus I bet he already
  knows him.&#8221;  Marissa turned toward Rodney.  &#8220;Hey Rod,&#8221; she said.
  Rodney paused and looked up, taking a sip of milk.  &#8220;Can you draw an
  <i>O</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming right up,&#8221; muttered Rodney picking up his pen.  He drew a
  large, deliberate circle and proudly held up his magnet pad.  &#8220;Now
  draw an E,&#8221; I said.  Rodney drew a capital <i>E</i>, filling up the whole
  pad.</p>
<p>We finished dinner, drove home, and put Rodney to bed.  Marissa gave
  me a haircut in the bathroom.  &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry it&#8217;s been so long since we
  got around to this,&#8221; said Marissa as tuffs of scruff fell rolled off
  my shirt onto the bathroom floor.  &#8220;Hey, I wasn&#8217;t asking for one
  either, that&#8217;s on me too,&#8221; I replied.  Staring blankly at the mirror
  while Marissa cut my hair kind of reminded me of that one Beyonce
  album cover where she&#8217;s cutting Jay Z&#8217;s hair in the bathroom - only a
  much less cool version of the scene.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong - I have my
  own brand of self-esteem, but I&#8217;m not Jay-Z.</p>
<p>I wrapped up a few chores, and we ended the night with a quick YouTube
  binge and a movie while I enjoyed a beer on the couch.  It was a good
  day.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to Tuesday.  Hope you have a great day today, and thanks for
  reading.</p>
