<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Sunday to everyone out there.  This
  morning, we&#8217;re all sitting around the table enjoying some French
  toast.  Going to bed last night, when Marissa and I calculated our
  wake up times, for some reason we were hell bent on waking up at 8,
  convinced the morning would tight.  But we were wrong, and here we are
  leisurely enjoying breakfast around the table with plenty of time
  before church.  The take-away here is that 11 o&#8217;clock church is the
  best.  You can stay up late, sleep in a bit, cook breakfast, and
  somehow still have time to go to church.  So here&#8217;s to the 11 o&#8217;clock
  church service - ride or die!</p>
<p>Yesterday was a wonderful day - once Marissa returned with the
  emergency coffee traveler from Moka.  Before then, I was just
  wandering around the upstairs of our house like a ghost.  Once Marissa
  returned with a box of coffee and I had the first sip, I felt
  empowered to start breakfast.  We treated Chris to a typical Recker
  family Saturday morning breakfast.  A pair of Dutch babies and bacon.
  We took our time around the breakfast table, digesting and drinking
  coffee, then head out for the day.  The plan was to take a little walk
  around the Atwood neighborhood to leave some art fliers in the coffee
  shops sprinkled around the downtown area.  There were even more coffee
  shops that I knew about.  As it got later into the afternoon, we
  deliberated on a place to eat lunch, and we settled on Lao Laang
  Xaang, the Laotion place on Atwood ave.</p>
<p>Lunch was tasty, but the whole experience dredged up an unpopular
  opinion we have about Madison, and that is most Madison restaurants
  really suck at hospitality.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong - there are plenty of
  places that have good food.  But you may have to wait an hour for it,
  and your waitress might huff if you ask for a water refill, and if you
  try to order an appetizer it will be forgotten the first time.
  Yesterday we watched our waitress nearly collide with a bus boy in the
  dining room and she quietly but audibly cussed him out.  She dropped a
  plate of crab rangoons that was still dripping with scalding hot oil
  in front of Rodney.  For the hour and a half it took to eat lunch and
  leave, we probably saw her three times, and two of the times she
  complained about how they&#8217;re running out of dishes in the kitchen.</p>
<p>I know it sounds like I had one bad experience and I&#8217;m crudely
  fashioning this anecdotal evidence into an ill-thought conclusion, but
  we have plenty of other stories.  We&#8217;ve only been cooking regularly
  for ourselves for about a year, and for the first five years of
  knowing each other, Marissa and I were habitual restaurant hoppers.
  &#8220;If you had to guess,&#8221; I later asked Marissa, &#8220;what percent of the
  visits to any typical Madison restaurant amount to terrible service
  experiences?&#8221;  Marissa paused for a moment and answered.  &#8220;Sixty
  percent of them are bad.&#8221;  Anecdotally, I agree.  And having already
  gotten plenty of flack from the Madisonian locals for this theory, I&#8217;m
  well aware that I&#8217;m not going to prove anything to you.  But for any
  Madisonians out there reading this, ready to rush to defend the
  restaurant scene in our beautiful little city, all I ask is that you
  start keep track of how often it takes an hour to get your food, how
  often a restaurant will get your order wrong, or - probably the most
  egregious thing of all - a waiter makes you feel guilty for showing up
  when it&#8217;s busy.  The worse part about this is that Madisonians are
  kind, and most of them probably apologize to waiters and waitresses
  that are short with them, or concede to eat their misplaced order and
  not make a scene.  The uncomfortable truth is that most restaurants in
  Madison can make good food, but most of them are also taking advantage
  of how nice the locals are and don&#8217;t take the same pride in giving
  people a good dining experience.  And like I said, I&#8217;ve given up
  trying to prove this to people.  Madison is growing, and if I&#8217;m right,
  the other shoe will drop, and soon even the good, long-suffering
  people of Madison will run out of patience for restaurants that treat
  patrons like an annoying roommate who keeps raiding their fridge while
  they&#8217;re trying to get work done.</p>
<p>Just putting that out there.  It&#8217;s a harsh criticism, and it bubbles
  to the surface of my brain whenever a friend or family member comes to
  visit.  If we eat out twice with them, there is a good chance they&#8217;re
  going to go home with a restaurant horror story.  We&#8217;re just tired of
  being embarrassed by local restaurants</p>
<p>OK, back to the happy Saturday recap.  After lunch, we walked to the
  grocery store and picked up some things for dinner.  On the way home,
  the bag I was carrying ripped, but luckily the two bottles of red wine
  were spared, and only the olive oil broke.  The garlic, cheese, and
  beef rolled onto the sidewalk slick and shimmering with oil.  We piled
  the groceries into Rodney&#8217;s blue car stroller.  We got a lot of funny
  looks from neighbors pushing a little blue car with two bottles of
  wine in the toddler cup holders, but it gave us a good laugh.</p>
<p>We napped as the beef simmered on the stove, and ate dinner in the
  evening.  Afterwards, we played Jenga.  I&#8217;ll tell you this, reader, if
  you ever somehow get tied up in a situation where you need to play
  jenga competitively, it would be good to have a trauma surgeon on your
  team.  Chris probed the wiggly jenga tower with the dexterity
  of&#8230; well&#8230; a surgeon.  Somehow the analogy is less powerful when
  it&#8217;s just the truth.</p>
<p>Well, time to close this entry off.  All the time in our generous
  pre-church morning has waned, and somehow I&#8217;m only left with ten
  minutes to shower and make my self presentable for church.  Hope you
  all have a wonderful day today.</p>
