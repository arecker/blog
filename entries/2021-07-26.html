<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everybody, and happy Monday.  It's nice to be here
today.  I hope you're finding some semblance of peace in this Monday
morning, whether it's the beautiful day, a fresh start, or just a hot
cup of coffee.</p>
<p>I've missed you all.  I took a whole two days off of blogging, and
though it felt kind of weird to keep the old journal so far out of
mind for so long, it was nice to have so much time for other things in
the evening.  This weekend, I tried to live in the moment.  I set out
to enjoy time with Marissa, Rodney, and Miles.  We partook in a good
mix of working, playing, and doing absolutely nothing.  It was a full
weekend, and we have a lot to catch up on.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em>.  The theme of this weekend was <em>crowds</em>.  It feels weird to say
that, coming out of a pandemic, but this weekend we first-hand
witnessed how eager people feel to get back out into the world to do
fun things.  I don't blame them - that's kind of why we were out too.</p>
<p>On Friday, we met up with Alex and Cassie for dinner.  We planned on
finding an outdoor table by the terrace to catch up and take in the
relaxing summer evening scene by the water.  But we were unlucky
enough to plan this alongside a Steely Dan concert.  People flooded
the streets.  The parking garages were overrun.  To a midwestern
college town half populated by middle aged alumni, Steely Dan had the
crowd stirred into a frenzy as if they were the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>We had no choice but to find a place to sit inside a nearby food
court.  We'd find refuge in a little round table in the middle of
another flock of people gathered to watch the opening ceremony of the
Olympics on a projector screen.  But hot tater tots, pizza, and beer
made us feel more settled in, and we had a nice conversation into the
night.</p>
<p>"We had better get out of here before it gets Rowdy," said Alex.
"People usually start pouring out of the bars around 9:30."</p>
<p>"It's 9:30?" gasped Marissa.  She glanced down at Miles, who was
nodding off in his stroller.  We parted ways, traversed all four
levels of the parking garage, and headed toward are car in the back
corner.  While I carried Miles, Marissa put Rodney in the stroller and
sprinted with him across the pavement.</p>

<p>After sleeping the late night off into Saturday morning, we finally
emerged to check out <em>Atwoodfest</em>.  The yearly neighborhood festival
was finally returning after taking a year off for COVID, and even its
modest one day comeback would pale in comparison to the all weekend
block party that used to fill the streets.  In fact it was so small
this year, we had trouble finding it.  Winding through the empty
streets following the sound of rock music, we finally encountered a
small crowd gathered in front of an outdoor stage.  The local cover
band <em>Steely Dane</em> was jamming out under a banner emblazoned with the
words <em>WE MISSED YOU</em>.</p>

<p>Crowds make some people uneasy, but sometimes I think I draw energy
from them.  Seeing the small crowd at Atwoodfest made me feel a pang
of love for my neighborhood.  Tattoos, leather, piercings,
cigarettes - they're not the most beautiful people in the world, but
they might be the most fun.</p>
<p>Rodney's eyes lit up while we wandered the crowd.  He slammed the rest
of his <em>bug juice</em>, and the sugar all at once hit his blood stream and
compelled him to dance.</p>

<p>When we had our fill of walking through the crowd (which didn't take
long), we bought some grilled sandwiches, a few beers, and squatted on
a quiet curb around the corner from the music.  Eating greasy food
with a beer outside and taking in the scenery - that's what summer
festivals are all about.</p>

<p>We even stopped for icecream on the way home.  Rodney ate his icecream
cone vigorously.</p>

<p>In other news, we had an unexpected spider feeding session over the
weekend.  Thinking Spidey was due for a live entertaining takedown, I
gathered the family into the bedroom to watch.</p>
<p>"He's hungry," I warned them.  "He hasn't eaten anything in a whole
week.  He's going to go crazy on this worm."</p>
<p>I plopped the worm in the box.  Spidey didn't move.  Using the tongs,
I inched the worm closer to his body.  Spidey scurried up his plastic
plant in fear.</p>

<p>Next, I tried to feed the tiny worm to Karta.  She didn't want to eat
either, but her burrow strategy proved to be a much more effective
escape plan than Spidey's.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll just cut it up and give it to glassy," I sighed.  That
was when Glassy, the underdog of the evening, finally gave us the
ferocious strike that we were all hoping for.</p>

<p>OK, maybe not <em>ferocious</em>.  But knowing we were all hoping for a show,
he tried his best and that alone is deserving of applause.  Great work
Glassy.</p>
<p>What a great weekend.  Thanks for stopping by today - have a great
Monday, everyone.</p>
