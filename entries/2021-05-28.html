<p>Good Morning Journal!</p>
<p>Well, it's the final week before Marissa and I go to Vancouver.  And I
can tell you I'm really feeling the burn.  This is probably the
hardest Monday I've had in a while, as far as the "sunday scaries" go.
This morning, even knowing there's a fresh pot of hot coffee
downstairs couldn't get me out of bed.  This morning I woke up at 4:55
AM to use the bathroom, and it's hard to describe the pure bliss I
felt getting back into bed, knowing I wouldn't have to move for
another 95 minutes (although this morning I took at extra 45 minutes).</p>
<p>I don't know, Journal.  It's hard.  Laziness is really starting to
creep into my life.  I find that the things I used to do with pride,
I'm kind of going through the motions with.  Even cooking doesn't seem
as satisfying as it used to, if I'm being honest.  I'm grateful that
in the meantime, while I'm battling laziness and apathy, I have still
have the structure of chores and routines.</p>
<p>I don't know where this growing sense of laziness and dread are coming
from to be honest.  Work has definitely been kind of crappy, but
usually everything else around me manages to cheer me up, and I have
no trouble living for the weekend.  I've gained a bit of weight -
maybe it's just feeling slightly out of shape while the weather gets
hotter.</p>
<p>Gosh.  I even missed journaling yesterday morning, and I've been
sleeping in later.  Yesterday morning I threw myself into the very
strange, tedious task of moving CloudFormation resources to
terraform - which is good work, but I didn't need to work on it first
thing in the morning for as long as I did.</p>
<p>Well journal, I think I'm officially in a funk.  And my best option
right now might be to just wait until it passes.  I'm here, right
where I'm supposed to be, and I have a wonderful life, and I have a
fresh cup of coffee and somewhere to go in five minutes.</p>
<p>Today I noticed an invite on my work calendar from some lady that
teaches mindfulness.  There's a session this morning.  I might go
check that out, perhaps I could benefit from the extra quiet time.</p>
<p>This week, I suppose we just cling to routines until we feel normal
about them again.  That's a pretty good battle cry for Monday, no?</p>

<p>Good Morning Journal!</p>
<p>Man, this cup of coffee is completely saving me today.  It's like I
wake up, and I feel like I'm staring into the abyss.  Then I take that
first sip, and I immediately feel like a different person.</p>
<p>But I'm not here to talk about coffee this morning.  I think I'm
beginning to see a pattern forming with my anger.  There's plenty of
entries in my anger log that show that I have outbursts when things
don't work right - like when I'm fixing code to do something, or a
recipe isn't working out, or when I can't set up a computer to do
something very easily.  It even happens when I can't beat a video
game.  I realized this last night while I was cooking dinner.  I
couldn't get the potatoes and the kale to mix, so I started to rage
and lash out.  I blamed Marissa for buying the wrong potatoes (even
though I told her they were fine the day before).  It made me realize
that I seriously lack patience.  When something doesn't work well the
first time through, rather than working through the issues, it seems I
lash out and blame other things.  When I can't immediately get code to
work, I blame the idiot upstream developers.  When I can't immediately
beat a video game, I blame lazy gaming companies and poor level
design.  When I can't get someone's computer working for them, I blame
greedy software companies for making their licensing too paranoid and
convoluted.</p>
<p>I've often explained away this tendency as "Oh no, I'm just very
efficient, and things that aren't efficient anger me."  But unplanned
problems and random error are a part of the universe and they have
nothing to do with efficiency, do they?</p>
<p>So what's the answer?  I think I lack patience.  Because I lack the
patience to work through the moments where my plan falls apart, I
yell, swear, throw dishes at the sink, and blame others.</p>
<p>I think I learned in college that Plato believed there was power in
contemplation - that if one wants to be brave, he should contemplate
bravery. Or that if one wants to be a better spouse, he should spend
time contemplating love and commitment.  It is clear to me I need to
contemplate patience.  I need to incorporate time to reflect on this
virtue regularly, and I think it's safe to say that most of my
contemplation occurs right in this text file.</p>
<p>So what is patience?  I'm kind of drawing a blank.  Now I'm really
convinced that I don't spend much time thinking about patience at all.
I can see parts of my life that make sense because I lacked patience,
but I don't know if I'm ready to just think about the virtue itself
quite yet.  Yesterday while I was washing dishes, I chuckled because I
remembered why I switched from biology to chemistry in college.  I was
doing really poorly on biology tests because I was unwilling to read
and actively listen to the material.  Of course, I blamed biology.
"It's all just rote memorization!"  I said.  And like with most of my
outbursts, I was kind of correct.  Biology is a lot of memorization,
but isn't everything?  What fields are out there that don't require
you to memorize anything, either passively or actively?  I turned to
chemistry because I happened to be in organic chemistry at the time
and it all made sense to me without having to read anything.  I liked
that you learned a system of rules, then just apply it to every
problem.</p>
<p>I don't think I'm a monster, or that I'm broken, or there is a problem
with the way my brain works.  I think in a way, my lack of patience
has made me really effective with certain things.  At work, I'm known
for finding solutions very quickly and getting code to work very fast.
I'm reminded of when we built all the new production pods last summer,
and there were all kinds of new crazy architectural constraints that
required lots of machinery to keep DNS records in sync.  One of my
proudest moments at work was when we designed this new system, and I
got it into production just a few hours working off of a diagram we
had scribbled onto a whiteboard.</p>
<p>I've spent pretty much my whole life practicing solving problems, but
I think that has led me to treat everything like it's a problem that I
can solve immediately.  So when something goes wrong, say, my butter
sauce is starting to separate, the solution is that it's my wife's
fault for not getting into the house on time.  In reality, there is no
solution.  The solution is to keep practicing making a butter sauce,
experiment with it, and through patience, work through the issues.</p>
<p>Let's continue to reflect on patience today.  To Thursday!</p>
