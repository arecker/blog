<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, readers.  Congratulations on making it to Friday.  I had
a nice, quiet morning.  We ate out last night, so I didn't have any
dishes to finish up.  Minnie and I just stared at each other while we
waited for the first pot of coffee to finish brewing.  I offered to
pour her some, but she said would rather wind up for the day by
brutalizing a roll of toilet paper or one of Miles' forsaken baby toys
in the living room.  Everyone has their own routine, and I can respect
that.</p>
<p>Are you feeling well-rested today?  I woke up once or twice last
night, and I also had to endure a goofy nightmare about chasing an
escaped tarantula around my high school.  It escaped a flimsy box in
the old chemistry lab.  I chased it down the dark upstairs hallway and
down the stairs into the attached pre-school.  I cornered it in front
of the art room, and just before I approached it with a catch cup, I
woke up and both of my arms were asleep.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em>.  So my first day on the networking team is in the books.  Day
one was everything I hoped it would be.  The team was kind enough to
send a small feature ticket my way, and this happens to be my favorite
way to learn.  Not only to I get to break out of <em>passive listening
mode</em>, but I also get the little dopamine rush of fixing something.
After a an hour or so fiddling with their script, I arrived at
something that worked.  I felt that twinge of imposter syndrome
vanish.  I felt like I had accomplished something.</p>
<p>I was also delighted to learn that my new team isn't afraid of a
little Bash.  For small automations, taste varies by team, and Bash
certainly falls on the old school side of the spectrum.  I thoroughly
enjoy it, but joining a new team you don't want to be the guy that
writes the first Bash script.</p>
<p>"Oh I love Bash," said my new teammate Derek.  "Bash is like a good
friend that farts a lot."</p>
<p>Well put, Derek.  Bash is tenured, honest, and dependable, but it has
its quirks.  It doesn't make me angry, but at least once per coding
session I get wrapped up in something small and stupid.  Sometimes I
even make the <em>somebody farted</em> face.</p>
<p>My new team invited me to an informal zoom call.  They gave me a tour
of some of their code, peppered with some free form discussion and
explanations.  Zendesk is a big company - so big that it's almost
impossible to see the entire thing in your head at once.  Yesterday
with the help of Derek, Joe, and Vicente, I began filling in the
details in totally new areas.  What was once a black box or a blurry
arrow in my head is slowly becoming whole other world teeming with
exciting new details.  It's an invigorating feeling.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon I attended a happy hour with my old team at the
biergarten.  They teased me, calling me a traitor, but it was easy
enough to make them jealous of my situation.  "I actually got to write
code today," I reported.</p>
<p>Marissa and I got a baby sitter last night.  Finley, her friend from
agility, came by the house just before dinner.  We ordered them a
pizza and gave her a quick rundown of bedtime routines.</p>
<p>Marissa and I were planning on driving downtown and finding a nice
place to eat, but secretly I think our ultimate date would be
transforming into a pair of houseflies on the wall so we could observe
how Rodney acts around a baby sitter.  It's not that we don't trust
him or we don't want to leave him.  It's just a side of his
personality that we never get to see.  How does he explain things?
What parts of his routine are important to him?  What things in his
bedroom are important enough to highlight for a stranger?  Oh God, am
I a helicopter parent?</p>
<p>Marissa and I parked downtown.  Walking beside each other, we lazily
circled the town square, peering into restaurants and watching people
shuffle on the sidewalk around us.  The square felt so new and
different, I barely remembered what it felt like to work there and
walk around every day.</p>
<p>"That place looks cool," I said.  "We should check it out."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about," laughed Marissa. "That's Coopers.  We've
eaten there a lot."</p>
<p>Case in point.</p>
<p>We found a seat at the bar at Graze.  I talked Marissa into ordering
some oysters on the half shell.  She warned me that raw oysters are
still her personal <em>texture nightmare</em>.  "It just feels like I'm
swallowing a big booger."</p>
<p>Oyster shells in hand, I gave her my best pep talk.  "It's all mental.
Just shut your eyes and picture your favorite food."</p>
<p>After dinner, we went for a long walk down State street.  We got some
ice cream and wandered around for the rest of the night.  We forgot
about how easy it was to wander the city when you don't have kids
tagging along.</p>
<p>That was pretty much yesterday.  Between a pizza party, a wedding
reception in Grand Rapids, and four different airplanes, I may not get
a chance to write again until Monday, but I'm going to bring my laptop
along and hope for the best.  But if I don't see you, hope you have a
great weekend.  Thanks for stopping by, friends.</p>
