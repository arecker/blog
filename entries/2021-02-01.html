<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everybody.  I officially declare this sunny winter Monday a <em>fresh start</em>.  We've rolled over into a new month.  There's a fresh dusting of snow on the ground.  We have a whole new work week to attack.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the era of makeshift paper towel coffee filters is finally coming to a close.  We're still waiting for our coffee machine to be fixed, but I finally remembered to add paper coffee filters to the grocery list.  It's a shame too - I was getting really good at them.  The meticulous tamping and tearing around the bumpy plastic cup turned out to be kind of a fun challenge.  I liked trying to make the paper towel snug up against the tray and taper against the top perfectly.  If this type of tedious task gives me joy, then maybe I should take up paper mache.</p>
<p>It's good to at least be back on our own supply of coffee.  Last week's grubhub debacle seems like it was so long ago.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em>.  So how are you feeling today?  Feeling optimistic about February?  Maybe the vaccines will be out a little sooner than planned.  Maybe the weather will turn around and we'll get to enjoy some rain and wet air for a change.  Maybe we'll be able to take a walk around the neighborhood as a family without losing feeling in our fingers.</p>
<p>Rodney and Marissa got their fill of the snow yesterday.  After church, Marissa went outside to shovel.  I offered to take a shift, but Marissa insisted that shoveling in the morning gave her a solid excuse to skip out on running in the afternoon.  I hung back with baby Miles, and Rodney followed her out into the yard with his bright green sled.</p>
<p>Marissa built a little snowdrift beside the driveway.  I watched Rodney take big exaggerated steps through the powder, clambering to the top of the snow drift like he was on a dangerous expedition.  He fixed the sled under him and leaned forward.  The green sled sent him whizzing across the icy pavement.  For a little snowdrift by our driveway, he was actually picking up some impressive speed.</p>

<p>The dogs got a good romp in the backyard as well.  Ollie was just out there to make sure everybody was safe.</p>

<p>Ziggy was also outside, but for more vain reasons.  She knows the sparkly white backdrop only accentuates her worldly beauty, and she wanted to be seen.</p>

<p>After watching Rodney take several trips down the tiny hill, we met around the back of the house for a snowball fight.  It was a one-sided battle.  Since Rodney can't yet make snowballs on his own, he's at a distinct disadvantage.</p>

<p>Rodney's time outside was cut short.  With kids it seems like there's a universal law that dictates the more snow gear they're wearing, the more likely they'll have to take a poop.  Rodney tramped his boots through the front door, shaking the snow all over the living room.  I helped him peel off his wet snow pants, jacket, and boots.  Rodney disappeared into the upstairs bathroom.  The door creaked behind him, and I could hear him hastily dig his training seat out of the bathroom closet.</p>
<p>Rodney has the pooping thing down to a science.  Barring unfortunate accidents like getting his shirt stuck, he's quick and he doesn't make a mess.  His pooping time is transactional, and almost business like.</p>
<p>"How's it coming, dude?  Do you want something to read?" I asked from outside the bathroom.</p>
<p>"Nope.  Nope <em>daysss</em>," said Rodney while straining.</p>
<p>"Want a comic book?  How about your Highlights magazine?" I pressed.</p>
<p>"I don't need anything," Rodney said assertively.</p>
<p>If you ask me, reading something while pooping is one of the simplest joys in life.  You'd have to be some kind of self-flagellating monk to turn that down (on a cold Sunday afternoon, less).  It's actually kind of intimidating.</p>
<p>While Rodney and Marissa finished up outside, I got lots of work done on the computer.  I listed some tech stuff on ebay and started on a big online photo album for pictures of Grandpa.  I downloaded all the pictures of Grandpa Recker that were shared on Facebook last week and sent them out to the family.</p>
<p>I'm still looking for stories to accompany these, but in the meantime I can show you the highlights.  Here's a photo from when I was in high school.  Grandpa leaned close into the camera to emphasize the silly hat he was wearing.</p>

<p>Another along the same theme, here's Grandpa wearing his self-cooling hat.  It was a gag gift he opened at Christmas.  The hat was equipped with plastic fans that were powered with a battery pack.</p>

<p>This is probably my favorite picture.  For most of my life people have questioned my undying love of White Castle cheeseburgers.  Thanks to pictures like this one, I have proof that it's just a family thing.  The Recker family has probably been enjoying White Castle for centuries.</p>

<p>Last one - here's a picture we took together with Rodney.  Between Rodney, myself, my dad, and grandpa, that's four generations standing next to each other.</p>

<p>That's what I got today.  Have a great day everyone.</p>
