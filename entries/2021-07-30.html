<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everybody!  Boy did I miss you all.  Yesterday around
this time I was sitting on the couch drinking coffee in preparation of
our chaos test at work.  I really expected to enjoy taking time off of
writing.  <em>It will be a nice morning</em>, I thought.  <em>Instead of writing
for an hour, I'll just get to drink coffee in silence for a thirty
minutes before my work day starts.</em>  It wasn't as relaxing as I
thought it would be.  I feel more moody and less social on the days I
skip writing.  I'm learning that this ritualistic daily yammering
plays a big role in getting my thoughts and feelings sorted out for
the day.</p>
<p>But <em>man</em> is it good to be back in the journaling saddle, and on the
best work day of the week especially.  I'm glad we got to check in
before a busy weekend of company and travel.  Oh, and happy Friday.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em>.  Just to set the stage here, it's 8:39 AM and only Rodney and
myself are awake.  While reading in the living room, I heard Rodney
crack his door open and cross the hallway to use the bathroom.  While
I was getting ready to jump in the shower, he stuck an arm out of his
bedroom and flagged me down.  "There's <em>pee</em> in my bed," he said with
disgust.</p>
<p>Rodney wets the bed occasionally, but he never fails to amuse me with
his posture of <em>finding</em> pee in his bed.  I'm not even sure if he
knows that it's his pee.  He doesn't show embarrassment or shame.  If
anything, he's annoyed.  He seems bothered by the fact that someone
would be so inconsiderate as to leave pee in <em>his</em> bed, and it's fun
to play along.</p>
<p>"What?  How did pee get in there?" I replied.  Rodney and I stood in
his bedroom staring down at the faded wet spot in his sheets.  "Super
weird dude.  Well, let's get a new sheet over it."</p>
<p>Rodney helped me clear off his bed.  While I stretched a new fitted
sheet over the mattress, he gave each of his forty stuffed animals and
bedside toys the old <em>sniff test</em>.  Good as new.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em>.  How's your morning going?  I hope nobody left pee in your bed.
And how was your Thursday?</p>
<p>Yesterday's earlier morning was different for us, but Marissa and
Rodney were good sports.  After kicking Marissa out of our bedroom a
half hour earlier than usual, she and Rodney set up in the dining room
for a painting session.  Marissa painted rainbows to give to Alice and
Frankie this weekend, and Rodney made some impressionist pieces of his
own.</p>
<p>"These are all roller coasters," Rodney explained.  It took me a
minute to take it all in.  Do you see any roller coasters in these
muddy smears and bright streaks?  I don't, but what do I know about art?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was upstairs at my desk on a zoom call, ready for my cue
to break the Internet.  Craig instructed me to run our script while he
was introducing the experiment.  "Don't tell people you're starting
it, it's more fun when they have to figure out when the outage
happened," he explained.  "It's a mini-game."</p>
<p>The experiment lasted until lunch.  Besides a few more meetings
sprinkled in the afternoon, that was pretty much my day.  I didn't
emerge from my room until 5:30, and I was having one of those
afternoons where I would head to the grocery store with no dinner plan
and no recipe list.  I came home with a stalk of asparagus, a bag of
frozen shrimp, a lemon, and a box of linguine.  I slapped together a
very rushed bowl of shrimp with garlic pasta and greens.</p>
<p>After dinner Rodney suggested we play a game at the table.  His new
Ryan's World <em>Springin' Spiders</em> set won over our usual Battleship or
Connect Four choices.  In <em>Springin' Spiders</em>, each player takes turns
trying to chip little plastic spiders into the air, and they are
awarded points if they get them to hook onto a plastic web.</p>
<p>I had my doubts.  Watching Rodney's forty-five dollar Dart Tag sniper
rifle deteriorate so quickly soured me to the entire line of Ryan's
World toys.  But <em>Springin' Spiders</em> seemed simple enough, and there
were no cheap springs or flimsy darts involved.</p>
<p><em>Springin' Spiders</em> shocked us.  In no time, we were roaring at the
dining room table.  It turns out that getting one of those little
plastic spiders to land on the upright web is just hard enough to keep
things interesting.  The game weaves together strategy, defense, and
dumb luck without being any more complicated than a silly drinking
game.</p>

<p>Speaking of spiders - just in you haven't gotten the <em>heeby jeebies</em>
in a while, I have some amusing spider updates.  I've recently started
to experiment with my most easy-going spider Glassy.  Every few days,
I take out his box and push him around with a soft tipped paint
brush.  When the brush comes from the back, he lazily walks forward.
When the brush comes from the sides, he gets a little scared at first,
but starts to turn and move.</p>
<p>But when the brush comes from the front?  He <em>attacks</em>.  He lunges his
small brown body forward.  His tiny fangs pass right through the soft
bristles.  Sometimes he even tries to hold down the brush with his
sticky front legs like he's trying to wrestle and pin down an unlucky
cricket.</p>
<p>The behavior had me a little worried at first.  Were my "experiments"
stressing him out?  Did Glassy have a hidden angry streak?  Last night
I found some answers when I stumbled into the "arachnoboards".  I read
stories about how tarantulas can strike at plastic straws or paint
brushes, thinking they're prey.  From my read on the situation, I
don't think Glassy is being defensive.  He's not shy or skittish.  I
think he just has a strong hunting instinct, and that's pretty cool.
Glassy remains my only spider that will eat in front of an audience -
the other two take their food in secret.</p>

<p>As a <em>non sequitir</em> ending to this post and as a parting gift for
heading into the weekend, have this video of Rodney acting like a
total wingiss during yesterday's quiet time.</p>
