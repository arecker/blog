<h2>1/29/07</h2>
<p>Read about your 2 hungry dogs,</p>
<p>They sound a lot like hogs,</p>
<p>Eating mutton, beef, chicken, quail, duck, and veal</p>
<p>It's no wonder that they have so much zeal.</p>
<p>A wild dog, as you well know</p>
<p>Can't sit around and be so slow.</p>
<p>He has to search for food, both day and night</p>
<p>Through feathers and fur he has to bite.</p>
<p>Even the water he drinks isn't always nearby</p>
<p>His throat can get awful sore and dry.</p>
<p>We too, must work and earn our daily bread</p>
<p>For our food, drink and shelter, we need not dread</p>
<p>We have a Heavenly Father, who knows our every need</p>
<p>If we but ask, He will supply our bed and feed,</p>
<p>We are thankful for our parents, who train us so well</p>
<p>Study His word and pray that others we may tell,</p>
<p>Keep us informed in what you plan to do,</p>
<p>Or anything else that is new!</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Grandpa Recker</p>

<h2>Weather in Northern Indiana</h2>
<p>June 15, 2008</p>
<p>Often in Spring our mornings are cool and damp</p>
<p>But by mid afternoon the sun is bright as a lamp.</p>
<p>Warms up to about sixty, need only a jacket or coat</p>
<p>Our past winter now seems far and remote!</p>
<p>It's good for the wallet, as gas heat costs a lot!</p>
<p>As we look forward to summer and weather quite hot!</p>
<p>Soon it is June and we now use our fans</p>
<p>Going outside, as we now get our tans.</p>
<p>July and August, our heat reaches its peak,</p>
<p>Now the air conditioner, as cooler air we seek.</p>
<p>What we save on gas, we spend on electric fees</p>
<p>Hoping once again for cool and gentle breeze.</p>
<p>September and October cooler nights with morning dews,</p>
<p>Leaves begin to change and send its warning clues.</p>
<p>November and December, soon the end of our year,</p>
<p>We love all our seasons, the new season we do not fear.</p>

<h2>Grandson Alex Recker</h2>
<p>12-28-2006</p>
<p>To our grandson Alex Recker we send our very best,</p>
<p>Since he is one of the best in Chicago Midwest,</p>
<p>We can't call him our little drummer boy anymore,</p>
<p>As he appears to be somewhere around six foot four,</p>
<p>Keep up your studying and getting good grades</p>
<p>We're so glad you don't wear earrings or braids,</p>
<p>Follow your dad's example all these many years</p>
<p>Don't get hooked on girls, bad habits, or many beers,</p>
<p>Keep up your Bible reading and of course daily prayers,</p>
<p>He hears you, loves you, and we know he really cares,</p>
<p>Take good care of your sisters, Kelly and Sarah Jean</p>
<p>Obey Mother and Father and don't be rude or mean,</p>
<p>In any job you do (Starbucks) give it the best you can</p>
<p>This is all part of becoming a Godly young man</p>
<p>Set a good example and don't go along with the crowd</p>
<p>Be a Christian in your behavior, of that you can be proud</p>
<p>Keep in touch with two grandmas and a grandpa as well</p>
<p>When you get a car don't be too quick to sell</p>
<p>Continue with the poetry, a gift which is also fun</p>
<p>With all this advice, I am now finally done!</p>
<p>With Love,</p>
<p>Grandpa Recker (3/4 of a century old)</p>
