<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>I wish I was a puppy.  Carrying out Minnie's daily morning routine, I
can't help but feel a little envious.  Imagine if somebody carried you
down the stairs every morning.  Imagine if the only thing you needed
to accomplish before climbing back into bed was taking a big poop in
the yard.  Oh, and did I mention that after you're carried back
upstairs, you get to enjoy a warm breakfast in bed?</p>
<p>I envy her routine, but I don't envy what she is eating.  Standing
over the sink, stirring hot water into her wet puppy mush affords me
lots of time to get to know the smell of wet dog food.  It's not my
cup of tea, but maybe it's an acquired taste.</p>
<p>I wonder what Minnie would think of that.  She might be outraged,
claiming her life is so simple.  Traveling across the country with a
family she just met.  Learning all the rules of the house with two
dogs and two older brothers lording over her.  And did we even mention
that the tape on her ears needs to stay there for a week?  The shame!
Being a puppy is no cakewalk, but she's doing a great job.</p>

<p><em>Sip</em>.  Good morning, everyone.  We've done it.  It's Friday, and
before dinner time today nobody from work will be able to bother us.
The sentence <em>vrijdagmiddag is bijna weekend</em> - Friday afternoon is
almost the weekend - is a regularly recurring practice sentence in my
Dutch lessons, but today serves as a battle cry.  To Friday afternoon,
and then onward to the weekend.</p>
<p>It's been a long, full week.  Knowing I'd just be bouncing between
remote conference talks, I guess I kind of underestimated how much
effort it would be to stay engaged.  I'm tired, just as if I had been
walking back and forth from these conference talks in person.  But I'm
also grateful.  I think my personal theme tying together all the
conference talks together is that my work is a big company, and there
are these entire other worlds of the company that I depend on.  It's
humbling thinking of how much work goes into the things that I'm not
even aware of.</p>
<p>It's been a fun conference week, but I'm ready to reign things in and
get back to a more regular cadence.  That's not a comment about the
conference specifically - I just have a low tolerance for things that
shake-up the regular Monday-to-Sunday week.  Marissa loves to tease me
about that one Christmas afternoon where I blurted out "Christmas is a
<em>weird</em> day."  If I can even get tired of Christmas, than it's nothing
personal.</p>
<p>It was a good day yesterday.  I attended some more talks and met with
some of my interns.  I was happy to hear that they appreciated the
short conference break from their regular work, especially with their
final exams right around the corner.  The nice thing about giving out
work to part time interns is that they always have something to do, so
you don't need to sweat it when the work isn't quite ready for them.</p>
<p>The last meeting of the conference was a closing celebration.  I
skipped out on it so I could start on dinner.  Yesterday we had beef
stew, and that's the type of meal that really shines when you can get
it on the stove earlier in the afternoon.  Not to mention I can enjoy
the time leading up to dinner a little more.  After signing off for
the day, I only had to slice up some potatoes and fry mushrooms before
I could join the rest of the family in the backyard.  While I was
putting the finishing touches on dinner, by the looks of it I missed a
spontaneous backyard photo shoot.</p>

<p>These pictures really give you a sense of Ziggy's personality, don't
they?  She is determined to hold on to the spotlight, even in the
presence of a new fluffy puppy.</p>
<p>After dinner, I met up with my old boss Heath for a beer.  Heath now
works with the university writing automation to support cancer
research.  He was nice enough to make the long drive from Fitchburg to
meet at the bar by our house.  The bar began to close down just as we
were nearing the bottom of our beer glasses, so we relocated across
the street to our house.  Heath arrived just in time to derail
Rodney's bedtime.</p>
<p>"Momma, there's a <em>guy</em> standing on our porch," announced Rodney
through the house.</p>
<p>Rodney stayed with Heath's family while we were having Miles in the
hospital, and that was the last time they saw each other.  But Rodney
didn't miss a beat in picking up where they left off.  If we had let
him, Rodney would have happily talked Heath's ear off into the late
hours of the night.</p>
<p>"Thanks for finishing up the night back here," said Marissa.  "I was
actually a little jealous that you got to get a beer and do something
fun."</p>
<p>"As you should be," I laughed.  "It was amazing.  I still get a little
thrill each time I can just walk away from our house and do something.
It always feels a little surreal."</p>
<p>It was a fun to catch up with Heath.</p>
<p>That's what I got today.  Thanks for stopping by today.  Hey - you go
and have yourself a wonderful weekend.  Maybe grab a beer with an old
boss that you're still friends with.</p>
