Dear Journal,

Good morning, everyone! Welcome to the new year. This morning, we slept
in, and over a cup of coffee Marissa and I planned our day, which will
be errands, projects, and leftovers. But before diving into the mundane
routine of a new year, I wanted to take extra time to reflect on 2019.
And what better way to reflect on the year than with snippets from old
journal entries?

Even though my first public blog post was in July ([party, dumplings,
and blogging]), I had actually been journaling privately since April.
This is my first actual journal entry.

My private entries resemble the public ones. Sometimes they were a
little more stream of conscious, crass, and unfiltered, but for the most
part they recap my day and reflect on major things coming up - just like
I presently do every morning. I even start off most of them with 'Dear
Journal'. Here's my comments on that from May 24, 2019. Journaling has
always been a part of my life in some way.

Spring of 2019 was a cleaning year. Marissa and I finally got a handle
on keeping things organized, and part of that came out of reorganizing
our kitchen. And now having a clean kitchen to work in every day,
cooking became a much bigger deal to me. A lot of my entries our about
cooking recipes. This entry from April 28, 2019 is basically an itemized
dissection of a failed attempt at Chicago deep dish pizza.

And here's another entry from June 28 where I anguish about my bad
jumbalaya.

Having dinner on the table at 7:00PM sharp has always been a big deal to
me. And that's become easier. Since then I've developed more cooking
common sense and better technique. Hitting the Recker Family 7PM dinner
standard isn't so hard anymore, but when it used to be a big source of
anger and frustration. If I was still in the kitchen at 7:05 PM, I was
probably gritting my teeth and bottling up an outburst.

Learning to cook forced me to learn patience, and learning patience
forced me to deal with my anger. I started keeping an anger journal. I
spent a lot of time trying to find patterns and commonalities behind
outbursts. Here's a snippet from June 20, 2019.

In the summer, Marissa and I took a vacation to Vancouver. I decided to
take a break from journaling. That vacation was my longest break from
writing since I started in April, and I regretted it. This was from June
18th, after we returned home.

This was the first time it became clear to me that journaling was no
longer just "something to stick to", but it actually enhanced my ability
to reflect on things.

I also learned the importance of focus in writing. I'm a great focuser,
but my problem is that I don't always focus on what's in front of me.
This is from July 1 - the day before I started publishing my journal
entries.

Some mornings it's hard to write, and I have to take five minutes to
actively clear my head. This year, I've learned that focus is a powerful
tool, but it's not a super power. It's a muscle, and I think you have to
flex it sometimes.

At this point, I've kept my family waiting for long enough. Rodney is
dressed and ready to kick of 2020 with a family trip to Denny's and some
errands. And so to conclude this entry, I'd like to take a minute to
thank the readers of this publication. Making these journal entries
public had to have been my favorite decision of 2019. I feel more
connected to the people around me, especially when an entry inspires
someone I haven't talked to in a while to send me a DM on twitter on
send me an email. It's fun luring people out of the social woodwork and
carrying on personal side conversations. And if you choose to silently
read and remain anonymous, that's just fine too. I like to think we're
still connected.

Happy new year, everyone. Hope you have a wonderful Wednesday, and a
great 2020.
