Dear Journal,

Let's try something totally new and different for Saturday, shall we?
Presenting, _our weekend, in pictures_.

---

I picked up an empty bag of chips that had blown into our front yard.
The special _RAP_ designation caught my eye.  What exactly does _RAP_
taste like?  What am I missing, having never tried the _Migos_ spin on
sour cream and ranch?  For shame - I may never know!

Rodney has spent most of the weekend in this cardboard box.  He reads
magazines and comic books in the box.  He eats play food in the box.
He holds lively discussions with _Hauncy_ in the box.

I finally decided to nix my shaggy quarantine hair.  Marissa lopped it
all off on Friday night in our bathroom.  Just for fun, we wanted to
see what I'd look like with a bowl cut.  Not only does it look bad,
but it makes me look like the kind of person you'd see on the evening
news, and not in a good way.  Get a good look - this will be the last
time I ever wear a bowl cut.

I stood along the wall in Marissa's chilly basement studio while she
cleared the area.  She crumpled up an old drop cloth and tossed it at
the base of the stairs.  She unfurled a new one, spotless and still
pleated from folds.  Moving more quickly than usual, Ollie slithered
between my legs to claim a prime spot on the new drop cloth.

"Ollie loves new drop cloth day," said Marissa.

What's all this?  It's the makings of an excellent Friday night,
that's what it is.  Both the kids were in bed.  All three dogs slept
soundly, sprinkled around the living room dog beds.  Marissa and I
cracked open a bottle of port, heated up some leftover Indian food,
and played a trash talk filled game of Battleship.  The original plan
was to eat cheese, but I absolutely struck out with my Hy-Vee
selection: bourbon smoked gouda - _gross_.

We had finished eating, and Marissa was holding Minnie at the dinner
table.  Minnie's little eye lids started to droop, and anticipating a
nap she nestled into Marissa's shoulder.  She stretched her legs one
last time, smacked her lips with a yawn, and squeaked like a baby.

"_Take a picture_," mouthed Marissa, trying not to disturb her.  I
reluctantly took my phone out and held it in front of me.  Marissa
started to yawn, and in a moment of expert timing, I snapped a photo
at the peak.  It was worth ruining a good photo.

I stood out on the porch in my room, lazily sipping coffee.  Rodney
and I were the only ones awake.  He hurriedly fashioned his green
grocs and slipped out the back door behind me lugging his big green
dinosaur, Hauncy.  "Hauncy has to go poop," he explained.

Either Rodney believes Hauncy really poops, or he was just extremely
committed to the role play.  He cross the back yard, retrieving the
pooper scooper.  He even picked up a few genuine deposits while
collecting what was left by _the Haunce_.

If there were a _terrible two's_ for dogs, Minnie would be the
mascot.  She's gaining confidence in her new habitat, and that's
causing her to show her naughty side.  On Friday night I turned my
back on her for twenty minutes to wash dishes, and I was so locked in
that I failed to notice the house grow eerily quiet.  Minnie took the
opportunity to pluck a little plastic cup of baby food off the bottom
shelf.  We discovered the evidence stashed under the dining room
table.  There was a dainty little hole chewed out of the middle of the
lid.  Minnie crawled into Marissa's lap.  Marissa hugged her, and the
sleight weight on her baby-food filled belly caused Minnie to burp
right in her face.

"It smells exactly like baby food," said Marissa.  "I think it was
banana pear."

After a Saturday pea soup dinner, we played Rodney's favorite game
_Robot Turtles_.  Rodney loves the game because the instructions
explicitly state that the kids who are playing get to boss around the
adults.  It's Rodney's time to shine, and he gets to arrange the
board, describe our goal, and add as many silly rules to the mix as he
wants.  Naturally, Marissa and I find it kind of hard to focus while
playing a game with no stakes, no real goals, and no consistent rules.
You could say that it makes us feel the way Rodney probably feels all
the time.
