<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Congratulations on making it to Friday.  May
your Friday be filled with good coffee in the morning and good wine in
the evening, and maybe a little beer somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>I'm especially excited for this Friday, as today is oven repair day.
It feels like so long ago since I scheduled this follow up appointment
to fix our oven, and in retrospect, I really underestimated how
difficult it would be to go without an oven for a month longer.
Curating meals without an oven is nothing short of maddening, and I'm
at my wits end - there's only so many things you can chuck in a pan or
in a Dutch oven on the stovetop.  Not to mention I'm really looking
forward to getting back on the homemade sourdough bread train.  All
this while, I've been feeding my sourdough starter <em>Krang</em>, and after
such a long hiatus, he is more bubbly and virile than ever.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em>.  So how was your Thursday?  Mine started off in Rodney's
sandbox.  Rodney and I spent the morning hanging in the backyard.  The
sun wasn't yet in full force, so we got to enjoy some cool morning
air, and of course a fresh pot of coffee.  Rodney beckoned me over to
his sandbox.</p>
<p>"Dada," he said.  "Come play sand with me?"</p>
<p>I felt I was due for some intentional playtime, so I walked across the
yard with my coffee mug and sat on a dry corner of his sandbox frame.
But that wasn't enough for Rodney - he wanted me <em>in</em> the sandbox.</p>
<p>"No dada, c'mere... c'mere!" he beckoned, patting the wet, gritty dirt
beside him.  I took a deep breath, one last sip of hot coffee, and
sank my bare feet in the sand beside him.  Rodney smiled.</p>
<p>"I don't know how you put up with all the gnats and the buggies over
here, dude," I said.</p>
<p>"They're my <em>friends</em>," replied Rodney.  Fair enough.  Rodney used a
shovel and a castle mold to bury our feet up to our ankles.</p>
<p>"This feels kind of good dude," I said giving my toes a good stretch.
"And it keeps the bugs off your ankles - good move dude."  It was like
Rodney was showing me the mysterious ways of adapting to his habitat
in the backyard sandbox.</p>

<p>Rodney and I spent most of the morning in the sandbox.  We played a
silly game where we pretended my big toe was a dormant monster, and
we'd have to bury it every time it broke through the ground.</p>
<p>"Why don't we wash up, dude," I said rising to my feet.  "I have to
water the grass anyway, I'm going to turn the hose on."</p>
<p>Standing from our deck, I sprayed Rodney with the hose, hoping to kick
off a fun backyard romp much like the one he had with Marissa earlier
this week.  But Rodney wasn't feeling it yesterday.  He immediately
grabbed his arms and scowled at me.</p>
<p>"TOO cold, dada," he shouted.</p>
<p>"Oh I'm sorry, dude - I thought you would like that," I said
apologetically.</p>
<p>Marissa joined us downstairs as I was getting Rodney changed into a
clean set of clothes.</p>
<p>"So I tried to spray him with the hose like you did the other day, but
he wasn't having it today - it must be a <em>mom</em> thing," I laughed.  "Do
you guys feel like lunch?"</p>
<p>With Marissa and Rodney relaxing in the living room, I left for the
kitchen, and made what was probably the most historically bad lunch
I've ever made.  The most substantive part of this lunch was a fried
quesadilla, which along with a few lazy handfuls of sliced turkey,
also had way too much mozarella.  Coming off the pan, the quesadilla
was dripping wet with grease.</p>
<p>And to throw even more poor decisions on this grease fire of a lunch,
I got too distracted trying to turn a frozen can of fruit into a ice
cream smoothie, which tasted only as good as the amount of ice cream I
added.</p>
<p>"OK guys, lunch is ready," I said, ushering Rodney and Marissa to a
table of greasy quesadilla slices and flavored melted ice cream.
"Lemme get you some Teddy Grahams for... you know... nutrients."</p>
<p>After lunch, I disappeared upstairs for an afternoon nap, and soon I
was back downstairs, trying to scrub the kitchen clean of cheese
grease and mistakes.  We ordered takeout from the <em>Great Dane</em>, and
Rodney, last at the table with food on his plate, was playing with his
dino chicken nuggets.</p>
<p>"Momma," he said tapping Marissa's wrist.  "Will it SINK... or FLOAT?"</p>
<p>"Sink," said Marissa, unsure what Rodney was referring to.  Rodney
raised a dinosaur shaped chicken nugget and dropped it, pretending to
plunge it into a tank of water, like Blippi.</p>
<p>"Dude, let's take this to the next level," I said getting out of my
chair.  I returned with a clear plastic pitcher filled with water.
"Sink or float - for real!"</p>
<p>We played a few more rounds of <em>sink or float</em>, letting Rodney act as
the honorary Blippi.  I even provided the music for him, humming the
sink or float theme that plays in the background of Blippi's videos.</p>
<p>"Dude - now the coleslaw," I said sliding the untouched plastic cup of
side coleslaw in Rodney's direction.  The thought alone of coleslaw
bobbing around in a pitcher of water made Marissa dry heave.</p>
<p>"OK - that's it for me," she said getting up from the table.  Our
innocent game of sink or float continued to go off the rails - we
added chicken nuggets, a few squirts of ketchup, Rodney's <em>Canada Man</em>
toy, and a few generous drips of pink food coloring.  We snickered at
the dinner table, studying the grotesque mixture in the pitcher.</p>

<p>I put Rodney to bed, and as I cleaned the kitchen and gutted our
fridge, I listened to an episode of <em>Chapo Trap House</em>.  Marissa and I
reconvened on the couch with beers in hand, and the political theme
spilled over into an evening conversation.</p>
<p>"So they raised a pretty good point in the podcast I listened to," I
began.  "So hospitals had such a hard time getting supplies - remember
pictures of nurses wearing garbage bags and re-using bloody face
masks" Marissa nodded.</p>
<p>"But how did the Police have enough supplies so quickly?" I continued.
"I read there were protests in all fifty states.  And not only did the
cops have masks, but plastic face guards, riot shields and tear gas
too.  Isn't that weird?"</p>
<p>"That <em>is</em> a good point," said Marissa thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Maybe they do have too much funding," I continued.  "The tanks,
rubber bullets, the riot gear.  It's just so over the top.  You have
to ask, 'why the hell do we need this stuff' - and so much of it!  You
know in some places, the cops don't even carry guns!"</p>
<p>We discussed the protests, riots, and police funding.  Marissa also
shared some insights from the audio book she's listening to.</p>
<p>"It helps to talk about this stuff," I said, taking a sip of beer.
"Things have been happening so quickly, it's easy to forget to take
time and process them.  I think it's important to talk things through,
and form opinions."</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by today.  Have a happy Friday.</p>
