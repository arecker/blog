title: calendar, velcro, minecraft, and batter

Dear Journal,

Good morning, everyone! I had a pretty productive day yesterday. I only
had a few meetings in the morning, so in the afternoon I made a list of
things I had to do and went through them, one-by-one. It felt good to
catch up on things, and when I got home, the momentum continued. Marissa
and I sat down and synced up the calendar for the next few weeks. For
one, I had the date for the reunion wrong. It turns out I have and extra
week to work on things. And the upcoming weekends don't look so bad.

After going over our calendar, I put some more work into the dining room
computer, adding velcro ties to cables. If you have some cable issues of
your own and you're still living in the dark days of zip ties, duct
tape, or just "wild style", I couldn't recommend [these velcro wraps]
more. They hold just as tightly as tape, but come off really easily and
they're reusable.

After tidying up the computer, I got some well-earned Minecraft time in.
I'm currently making a bridge from my little platform to the shore,
building it right against the water. Still trying to keep things
practical, and it's working out. I think this may be one of my favorite
spots I've ever picked. I'm way out on the ocean on this little island.
Building on water always works out well because it's easy to grow crops,
and there are way less monsters to deal with.

For dinner (real dinner, not Minecraft), I made fried fish. I think I've
really honed my batter recipe. The secret is to make it very watery.
It's tempting to stir in more flour and make it velvety and appetizing,
but you have to stop a little sooner when it's just a little thicker
than cream. I also cut the fish into really small pieces - little strips
that cooked in the oil in about forty seconds. It was a great batch, and
I was happy with it.

Today will be more of the same. Still finishing up intern work. We're
writing a blog post about our project now, which involves compiling all
the trial data, making diagrams, and lots of writing. So this week feels
like a victory lap with lots of editing.

Hope you have a wonderful day today. Happy Tuesday, everyone.
