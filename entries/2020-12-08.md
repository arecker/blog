Dear Journal,

Good morning, everyone!  Welcome to Tuesday.  It's a beautiful day
today in Madison Wisconsin, in a cozy and gloomy kind of way.  The
swirling grey clouds overhead feel mysterious, and make me think we
might get to enjoy some snow in the near future.  It makes me feel
like curling up on the couch with an endless supply of coffee.

Tuesday is also our garbage day, and before we get going with the
regularly scheduled journal entry, I'd like to give a shout out to my
neighbors for having their recycling bins at the end of the driveway
early enough to jog my memory and take out our own recycling.  Missing
recycling day would be a royal bummer, as it would mean we'd have to
wait an excruciating two weeks before another chance to move things
along.  A near miss and a close success this morning.

_Sip_.  Did you remember to take your recycling bin to the end of the
curb?  How are you feeling today, and how was your Monday?
Regrettably I had one of my more stressful days at work yesterday.  I
was pulled between lots of meetings.  I've fallen victim to some
competing priorities that make it hard to focus and actually finish
anything.  On top of everything, yesterday we were told about some
non-trivial changes on the team.  That might sound cagey, but that's
as descriptive as I can be.  I might like to blab openly about my day
to day life, but that's probably not the case with my work.

The point is that work was stressful.  And if not for the excellent
reheated bowl of pea soup and croutons I had to look forward to, I
probably wouldn't have made it until lunch.  Yesterday as I was in the
kitchen hurriedly heating up my soup before the next meeting, Marissa
brought in a stack of packages from outside.  Per our Christmas
secrecy protocol, she opened up all the boxes that were addressed to
me to screen for presents.

"Were you expecting... some presents?" she asked with a smile.

Watching my soup heat up in the microwave, I leaned into the dining
room, my eyes lighting up.  "I think I was," I beamed.  "Is it a bunch
of Bears stuff?"

Marissa smiled and nodded, sliding the box my way.  This year, I
participated in the Bears subreddit gift exchange, which is
hilariously named _Secret Ditka_.  After a demoralizing loss to the
Lions and a whirlwind of a work day, my gift couldn't have arrived at
a better time.

So now, we play the first round of "what'd ya' get" - Secret Ditka
edition.  The first piece of the gift actually arrived last week.  My
designated Internet stranger got me a nice pair of grill tongs that
Marissa christened with her barbecue pork skewers.

In yesterday's unboxing, a ridiculously snug zip-up, a pack of Bears
logo printed guitar picks, and a toy football.

<p>"Don't worry, you don't look awkward AT ALL," said Marissa behind the camera.</p>

Rodney, watching TV on the couch, noticed me walk into the living room
with my arms suspiciously held behind my back.  He paused the TV to
see what I had.  I flipped him the football.

Rodney would watch TV with the football in his lap until lunch time.

My Secret Ditka nailed it this year.  Generous and detailed, I can
tell some real thought and quality reddit stalking went into this
gift.  And that just makes the exchange more fun for everyone.

Marissa offered to pinch hit for dinner.  As I napped the stressful
work day away, she slaved away downstairs, cleaning the house up and
making seared salmon for dinner.  After scarfing down the delicious
fish, she brought out the red velvet cupcakes she had made with Rodney
for dessert.

"Did you know that red velvet cupcakes were originally red because of
a chemical reaction with the cocoa powder?" she said.  "They're really
just chocolate cupcakes."

I nodded along silently with my mouth stuffed with cake and frosting.

After dinner, we gathered on the couch as a family for the new Dude
Perfect video.  When we had finished, Marissa sent me away to work on
my end of the year mixtape.

"So my day ended with a nap, free dinner, and now I can go upstairs
and edit music together," I remarked.  "Today I basically feel like a
college student living at home."

A hip-hop mixtape hardly sounds like a strong case to get out of
putting the kids to bed at night, but putting aside any false modesty,
it's going to be straight fire this year, and I appreciated the extra
time to focus on the project and get it done.  After I had finished, I
compared this year's tracks with my line-up for 2018 and 2019.  I've
noticed I'm hilariously predictable.  Unintentionally, the mixtape is
always fifteen tracks long, and nearly the same duration - this year
included.  I didn't set out to gather fifteen tracks.  It just
happened.  On a much smaller scale, it reminds me about that old
legend of how seventy-two different scholars independently translated
the old testament into the Greek septuagint and in the end all
seventy-two versions were identical.  Not to be sacrilegious, but
after a coincidence like that, I have no choice but to call it
complete.

Here is the this year's track list.  As always, send me an [email] if
you would like a copy this year, but fair warning - swears and mature
subject matter abound.  This is rap music after all, and I'd argue
it's a very important part of the art form.  Treat the following
tracks like a platter of sushi.  Some of it might be off-putting, but
it's part of the experience and an open mind is essential.
