title: cooking, youtube, and being busy
---

Dear Journal,

Happy Monday! Fun fact - this is actually the second journal entry I've
written this morning. I've spent the last 23 minutes writing, then while
thinking about what to write and fiddling with my power cord, I
accidentally rebooted my computer without saving anything. Not to worry,
I'll just have to bring you back up to speed with the 7 minute version.
To sum up, my phone woke me up last night at 4:30 with what I thought
was a work page, but just turned out to be a Linked In notification. I
also found a new cooking YouTube channel that is 80% solid advice and
20% blog spam that is still worth making fun of. The example I cited was
their 4 minute video on "bringing your caprese salad to the next level"
which could have just been summarized with "use expensive ingredients".
There - I think I'm caught up.

This week should be pretty busy. I'm on ticket duty, and after
absolutely crushing it last week our interns are running out of work. So
I have to do a bit of a scramble to keep them busy. This Friday is a
work picnic, and this weekend the Rod man and I are holding it down on
our own while Marissa is at my sister's bridal shower.

I hope you all have a wonderful Monday morning. To conclude this brief
post, I offer some parting advice: save your work before you touch your
power cable.
