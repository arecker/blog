Dear Journal,

Good morning, everyone!  Welcome to Wednesday, the highly anticipated
halfway point in the work week - where beginning of the week hustle
meets the end of the week longing for the weekend.  Coffee, routines,
and notes are behind us, and naps, snacks, and hobbies are in front of
us.  I think at this point, I'm just trying to do whatever I can do
avoid calling it _hump day_.  Damn, I really do hate when the perfect
term for something is also the overused term for something.

_Sip_.  The other day, Rodney stopped us in the middle of our bedtime
routine, right between story time and prayers.  His tone was gravely
serious.  "Dada," he said, "no more X-men, and no more dragonball.
_Too scary_."

I stopped for a moment, giving his interjection time to sink in.
Rodney is a three year old, and it can be hard getting a three year
old to focus on even simple things like brushing his teeth or
finishing his plate of food.  So for him to remember something and
bring it up in conversation on his own, this must have been weighing
on him significantly.

"Al right dude, you got it." I replied.  "This must have been a tough
decision for you.  Thanks for bringing it up."  I felt a twinge of
guilt.  Officially, Rodney was too young to watch shows like X-men,
Ninja Turtles, and Dragonball.  But he seemed to really enjoy it and
ask for it again.  Did I make a bad call?  Perhaps, but it was not the
time to feel guilty about it.  That wasn't Rodney's problem.  The
important thing was that he was making a decision that something
wasn't good for him, and he needed help sticking with it.

"Thanks for telling me Rodney.  We'll find a new show for you to
watch.  Maybe something with less fighting, huh?"

The next morning, Marissa and I set him up with _Backyardigans_.  It's
a show about a bunch of animals who, as Marissa summed it up, "just
get together and screw around in their backyard."  It was an instant
hit.

"Sometimes I like to spy on Rodney through the reflection of the
window so he doesn't get embarrassed.  He was standing up, swaying
back and forth with the dance in the show," Marissa recounted.  She
demonstrated, crouching low and gently swaying, swinging her arms like
a skier on a leisurely ride.

And the music is good too.  _Backyardigans_ does a good job adding in
different styles of music that don't sound too brainwashy.  All
morning, the house was quiet.  There were no fist fights, battle
cries, or slashing of swords.  Just the gentle, dulcet tones of age
appropriate children's programming.

The work day flew by.  I took notes, attended meetings, read code, and
did all the necessary preparations to keep the _agile story_ hopper
filled with well-groomed work.  Before long, it was quitting time and
my thoughts shifted toward dinner.  I got Rodney out of his room, and
together we made our way into the kitchen.

"What are we making today, dude?" I asked, fixing my apron around my
waste.  Rodney ignored my question, digging his favorite butter knife
out of the drawer and grabbing his step ladder from the corner.
"Let's do soup," I said, answering my own question.

We stood side-by-side at the cutting board.  I chopped an onion while
Rodney fiddled around with the off cuts and onion skin before I balled
them up in a paper towel.  Celery, carrots, and leftover Easter ham
followed, eventually finding their way into hot butter at the bottom
of our Dutch oven.

"OH dude," I exclaimed.  "We don't have any bread!  Is there anything
worse than soup with no bread?"  Rodney turned around from his spot at
the sink, where he happily splashing around all under the guise of
"helping me rinse kale".  He gave a sheepish smile, as if to say
"_whelp, good luck with that_."

It was in this moment that Rodney and I invented the greatest original
recipe that has ever left our kitchen.  With great pride, we present
the steps to recreate _speed bread_.  Fair warning - I haven't had a
chance to clean this up, and for the sake of reproducibility I have no
other choice but to list the steps exactly as they happened.

Materials:

- flour
- yeast
- sugar
- salt
- honey
- olive oil
- a Rodney

Procedure:

1. Turn the oven on at 350F.
2. Pour 1 cup of hot water into a bowl and add 1.25 TSP of yeast.
   Dump in some sugar.  Use the same bowl of sugar that Rodney was
   eating out of with his bare hands when you weren't looking.
3. Give the yeast 10 minutes to bloom.  In this time, have your Rodney
   absentmindedly stir and poke the warm yeast water with his fingers.
   For best results, ensure Rodney's fingers are still sticky with
   sugar and leftover Easter ham that he was also eating when you
   weren't looking.
4. Add 1.25 TSP of kosher salt and several small squirts of honey.
   Use a honey jar that is _almost_ empty - the kind that makes fart
   noises when you squeeze it.  Give Rodney plenty of room to laugh as
   you act out each "fart" of honey into the bowl.  Cross your eyes,
   pucker your mouth, strain your face.  There's no excuse to not make
   a three year old boy laugh with fake farting, it's always a hit.
   Use 5-7 good "farts" of honey in total.
5. Stir the ingredients together with a whisk.  Add a cup of flour and
   stir.  Continue to slowly add more flour until a shaggy dough
   starts to form.  If needed, switch to a wooden spoon, handing the
   whisk to Rodney so he can lick the raw dough off of it when you're
   not looking.
6. Kneed the dough in the bowl.  Keep kneeding and sprinkling in flour
   until the dough is sticky enough to clean remaining flour off the
   sides of the bowl, and is still sticky enough for Rodney to pull of
   pieces and stick them to the back of your neck, but don't give him
   the reaction he's looking for, it will only encourage him to put it
   in your hair.
7. Turn the dough ball inside out, cover with olive oil, and leave it
   in the bowl covered by a towel.  And place it in the oven... oh
   shoot, did you leave the oven on this whole time?  It was not
   actually supposed to get to 350 degrees, we just needed it warm for
   the yeast to rise.  Shoot.  OK screw it, just put the bowl in the
   oven with the towel, and if you smell smoke or plastic, get ready
   to pull the pin off your fire extinguisher with one hand while you
   call in a pizza with the other.
8. Let the dough rest and rise in the oven for a half our.  Take out,
   and do your best to fold it and deflate the air without turning it
   into a sticky dough party.  Add as little as flour as possible, or
   at least convince yourself that flour is no longer needed, because
   you finally put it away and cleaned up Rodney and it's not worth
   getting out again.
9. Dump the dough out onto a silpat or nonstick surface.  Stretch it
   out like a pizza, but do not flatten it.  Let Rodney pull off a few
   more pieces for his amusement while you swat his wandering hands
   away from your creation.
10. Preheat the oven to 450F.  Cover the bread in a towel and set it
    aside.
11. Bake the bread for 20 minutes.  When there is 5 minutes left (or
    when the noodles in your soup are falling apart and you need to
    just wrap up this shit show), pull out the bread and drizzle with
    olive oil.  Stick it back in the oven, and indecisively stand
    there while you wonder why you dumped olive oil over the top and
    didn't bother to cover it.  Take it out again and attempt to brush
    evenly with your hand.  Burn your hand, then switch to a spoon.
    For best results, use the same spoon that you've been stirring
    your soup with because Rodney hid the others.
12. Remove from the oven.  Tear the bread, and breathe a sigh of
    relief seeing that it is edible.  Sit back in satisfaction
    watching your pregnant wife devour it.
	
So that's speed bread, what a wonderful accident, huh?  Boy I got
carried away with that one.  Thanks for stopping by today.  I hope you
have a wonderful day.
