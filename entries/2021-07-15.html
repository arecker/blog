<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everybody.  Happy Thursday.  The grey, overcast sky
feels perfect right now.  I can't complain about the relaxing dim
lighting, the cool air, and the general sense of coziness permeating
my writing space.  Oh yeah, and it complements this hot cup of coffee
perfectly.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em>.  It's good to be here today.  We're already at Thursday, and
the week is about to get a lot busier from party planning, party
throwing, and party clean-up.  So right now I'm determined to enjoy
any moment of brief quietness that I can get my hands on.</p>
<p>Before we get going, we need to have a talk about setting
expectations.  I've recently learned that I'm a huge spider dork.  I
don't get tired of learning about them, and I'm afraid that now I
think about them so often that if I wanted, I could fill any pause in
a conversation or blank journal entry with spider observations, spider
learnings, and spider reflections.  I'm even sitting here right now
wearing the new tarantula shirt I got specifically for Rodney's
birthday party, and I feel so cool in it that it borders on
embarrassing.</p>
<p>This blog is probably going to have an up-tick in the spider related
content.  This is bad news for you if you like to read this blog and
you hate spiders.  I understand some people get the shivers from just
thinking about spiders.  One friend told me that watching my Instagram
story caused him to involuntarily chuck his iPhone across the room.  I
wish I could simultaneously indulge my new fascination while
protecting your phobias, but that's kind of hard to do in a blog about
my life.  The spiders have invaded alex-recker-dot-com, and I don't
think they're leaving any time soon.</p>
<p>But even if you are afraid of spiders, maybe you can learn to like
them.  Through watching and observing these little critters, I find
new ways to relate to them all the time.  For instance, have you ever
felt the need to eat something even though you weren't hungry?  Maybe
you felt the need to gorge on a box of your favorite cereal before
your siblings could get to it.  Maybe you have microwaved some
leftovers in your fridge from a favorite restaurant because you knew
it wouldn't taste as good the next day for lunch.  Maybe you felt the
need to gobble down the last remaining sushi rolls at the table
because sushi is kind of expensive and you don't eat it very often.</p>
<p>This is called opportunistic eating, and spiders do it too.  Spiders
don't get to eat regularly.  In the wild, they dig burrows and set
traps, and spend most of their time waiting for food to cross their
path.  This may be days, weeks, or months, so they've adapted to eat
whenever they can.  For this reason it's actually pretty easy to
overfeed a spider.</p>
<p>Even though Spidey had already eaten a few days ago, I decided to give
him another worm.  I figured he's a juvenile, and his growing body
would throw the excess energy into another molt anyway.  Also, he must
have been famish from digging his burrow all night.  I found him the
next morning resting beside a giant pile dirt, and his water bowl was
completely empty.  I gently placed a super worm in the corner of his
enclosure.  This worm was being a real dingiss.  In direct violation
of his responsibilities to crawl as a larva and eat fresh vegetables,
he was instead trying to curl up alone in the corner and form a pupa -
an easy snack for a hungry tarantula.  He made quick work of the
misguided worm, then returned to his fancy new burrow.</p>

<p>In other news, work is really picking up.  I'm writing code, deploying
services, moving tickets, and learning the tools of this new trade.
It feels good to finally start digging into things.  I feel like this
week, especially yesterday, might mark the beginning of my own
personal renaissance of finding fulfillment in work.  I worked with
Derek on tracking down a metrics issue in our mesh monitoring.  I
worked with Joe on building out a new set of route tables and NAT
gateways.  I learned so much just listening to Vicente walk through a
recent incident he resolved that after the meeting I had to get up and
stare out the window for the same amount of time just to finish
absorbing it all.  It's an exciting time, and I feel incredibly lucky.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marissa and Rodney have already started to decorate for the
big party on Saturday.  He and Marissa went wild with construction
paper, pipe cleaners, and googly eyes.  All morning I could hear them
cackling in the dining room at every silly creature they fashioned.</p>

<p>We also took some time yesterday to purge Rodney's toys, as we do
every year to make room for new birthday toys.  We told him that we
were going to give the toys he didn't want anymore to his "fans",
which played into his ongoing <em>Ryan's World</em> fantasy nicely until he
started high-jacking the narrative.</p>
<p>"Yeah, and <em>then</em> my fans will fix my toys, and give them back to me,"
he added.</p>
<p>"No," said Marissa.  "They're going to keep them.  Your fans will keep
the toys forever."</p>
<p>"You gotta take care of your fans, dude," I added.</p>
<p>Rodney was less agreeable about this year's great toy purge.  We
cleared enough headroom in the inventory for this year's batch of
presents, but he still has <em>a lot</em>.  "Look at home many animals this
kid sleeps with," laughed Marissa quietly.</p>
<p>Mere inches from his head, Rodney sleeps with the entire Paw Patrol, a
family of giraffes, a family of t-rexes, a family of brachiosauruses,
a spider, a puppy, a toy robot housing a miniature robot in its body,
and two giant boa constrictors.</p>

<p>As a counterpoint to his crowded bedtime scene, his brother Miles
sleeps with nothing.  Jut a happy baby in a white crib in the corner
of an empty room.</p>

<p>Kids are so silly.  Thanks for stopping by today, have a great
Thursday everyone.</p>
