## A Political Cartoon

I clicked our bedroom light off and climbed into bed.  Even though it
was well after midnight, Marissa and I would spend the next thirty
minutes on our backs stabbing at our brightly lit phone screens in the
darkness.  The bedsheet stirred as she chuckled, then she rolled on
her side, holding her phone screen out for me to see.  It was a comic
of the statue of liberty aiming a cartoonishly evil Donald Trump at
the sky, using a surgical mask as a slingshot.

"I like that," I said smiling.  "Nice."

"I think I'm going to add it to my story," said Marissa.  But by the
time she had rolled back to her side, I was already asleep - probably
snoring.

Marissa's Instagram account hovers around 110 thousand followers, and
if the people that follow her fluid art account resemble the general
population of America, it would stand to reason that a little less
than half of those 110 thousand people would find the political comic
offensive.  The next morning, while we were sitting at the table
cutting into a hot Sunday morning brunch, Marissa once again held out
her phone.  This time, she was showing me a conversation over DM.

"I got some angry replies for that comic," she said.  "Look at this
person."  She adjusted her posture in her chair and began to read the
comment aloud.

"'You should ask _Siri_ who the president of the United States is'-
and then she unfollowed me," said Marissa smiling.

I chortled through a sip of coffee.  "There's a lot to unpack there,"
I smirked.  "Clearly she meant it as some kind of burn, as if you
weren't aware that Biden's term doesn't begin until January, not to
mention treating _Siri_ like some kind of all knowing mediator."

We were laughing, but I could tell something about the subject was
weighing on Marissa.  It followed her around the house like her own
personal rain cloud.  I broached the subject again, this time more
earnestly.  Laying out all her possible motivations on a figurative
table for scrutiny, we tried to answer this question: _Why did you
feel the need to post that?_

Marissa had the right to share her opinion, even if it garnered back
lash.  Her post wasn't vulgar.  It wasn't a cheap shot.  It was
undeniably clever.  But what did it accomplish?  Did it sway anyone?
Did it inform anyone of anything?  Was it worth doing in the first
place?

## Before the Internet

In hopes of deconstructing Marissa's true motive, I tried to imagine
the situation without the Internet.  "If Facebook and the Internet
didn't exist, if this conversation happened twenty-five years ago,
then would it have been a polite interaction?"

Marissa wrinkled her nose and laughed.  "Where did people even go to
do that kind of thing?" she asked.  "I never did that kind of thing, I
just avoided talking politics with people in person."

Marissa's question reminded me of Todd, a good friend of mine in grade
school.  Todd invited me over to his house for dinner.  There were
cloth napkins and shiny silverware set out on the table.  His mother
and father sat at the head chairs.  Reading the room, I perceived that
their family took etiquette seriously, and so I kept my elbows off the
table and remained sharp with my _please_'s and _thank you_'s.  After
cleaning our plates, we stayed at the table a little longer to indulge
in small talk with dessert.

"Can I tell a joke?" said Todd.  We listened silently while Todd
recited his joke from memory."

> A man dies and finds himself in Heaven.  St. Peter greets him and
> takes him through the pearly gates.  To the man's surprise,
> St. Peter opens a door and leads the man into a room full of clocks.
> There were clocks all over the ceiling and walls of the big vaulting
> room.  "What are all these clocks for?" asks the man.  St. Peter
> replies, "each person on earth has a clock of their own.  And
> whenever they tell a lie, the clock ticks one second."  The man
> stared around the big room in wonder.  "Every person?" he asked.
> "Babe Ruth?"  St. Peter pointing to a clock near the floor on the
> opposite wall.  "That one right there is Babe Ruth's clock."  The
> man clapped his hands with glee.  "How about Abraham Lincoln?" asked
> the man.  St. Peter pointed to another clock.  "He was an honest
> man," said St. Peter.  "Barely moved his whole time on Earth.  In
> fact, all of America's Presidents are on that wall."  The man
> studied the neat row of clocks, and noticed that one of them was
> missing from the sequence.  "Whose clock used to be there?" asked
> the man.  St. Peter pointed behind him.  "That's where Bill
> Clinton's clock used to be, but we moved it to the rec room.  It's
> hot in there, and his clock helps circulate the air."

After Todd had finished his perfect recitation, his father cleared his
throat and shifted uncomfortably.  He painted over his son's _faux
pas_ with some nervous laughter.

Todd's joke lives in my memory almost twenty-two years later.  Not
only is it clever, but it serves as a good analytic sample for what
discussing politics felt like before the Internet.  Todd's joke is
wordy and polite because it had to be.  The set-up was long, and by
the time he reached the punch line, we had to sit with the
uncomfortable silence.  A Mexican stand-off of dinner table etiquette
where we each silently deliberated whether or not to reward the
performance with a laugh.

But how would his joke land on Facebook?  It's just too wordy I think.
Most people would see a wall of dry text and scroll right past it.  On
Facebook, politeness is drudgery, and a good viral post leverages the
fact that there's no dinner table decorum to preserve.

Perhaps I'm just jaded, but I can't imagine a single place on the
Internet where constructive, open-minded political discussion is
taking place.  And if such a place did exist, it sure as hell isn't
anywhere near Facebook.  Facebook is not a forum for real discussion.
It's an unruly mob huddled around a fist fight in the parking lot.
It's a sea of disembodied eyeballs scouring the Internet for contrived
situational poetic justice.  People don't use Facebook because they
want to learn.  We just want to see the people we don't like get
exposed, embarrassed, and - in the parlance of the Internet - get
_owned_.  Could this be why we bother talking politics on Facebook?
Are we just bullies in search of people to bully?

## Building a Brand

"You don't think I was _virtue signaling_," asked Marissa.  Her face
wrung with pain, like she was disclosing an embarrassing medical
issue.

To me, the term _virtual signaling_ perfectly captures everything that
feels wrong about social networking on the Internet.  One night,
following the term into a Wikipedia rabbit hole, I discovered that it
was coined around the same time as the Ice Bucket challenge.

"Do you remember the ice bucket challenge?" I asked Marissa.

"Oh yeah," she laughed.  "Of course.  That was when you posted a video
dumping water on yourself, and then you got to challenge your friends
to do the same.  I don't remember what it was for."

Nobody remembers the point of the Ice Bucket challenge.  Even though
it was started by a charity collecting donations for ALS research,
most people who participated in the fad didn't donate to the actual
cause.  It was just a virtue signal.

Sometimes I wonder if political content makes it way to places like
Facebook by way of its users' pervasive need to curate an online
identity.  Social networks have a way of grooming us into dutifully
tending to glamorous, ultra-pasteurized products distilled from our
uneventful watered-down lives.  We feel a constant bombarding pressure
to craft pithy observations for our twitter, stage beautiful meals for
our Instagram, and drop razor sharp, scathing truth bombs for
Facebook.

## A Legacy in Data

"I don't think you were virtue-signaling," I said, consoling Marissa.
"You're not a shallow person, and the fact that you're still thinking
about this after the fact makes me sure of it.  Maybe you're just
thinking about your legacy."

Nothing on the Internet is ever truly deleted.  Even if you delete
your Facebook post out of regret, you can't delete people's
screenshots of your post.  You can't stop people from copying your
post and sharing it elsewhere.  You can't even trust Facebook to
actually delete it.  In software, the jargon term _soft delete_
describes a process in which you delete something from the visible
user interface while leaving it completely in tact behind the scenes.
The truth is once something is shared on the Internet, it lives
forever.

And where data lives forever, we have to grapple with the
uncomfortable truth that it will inevitably be studied forever.
Historians a hundred years from now might very well used archived
records from Facebook and Twitter to better understand how our history
unfolded, and there's no reason why they wouldn't have access to a
swelling wealth of data.

Being raised on the Internet, young people understand this better than
most, and not all of our actions are driven by a need to curate an
artificially glamorous version of our mundane lives.  Some of our
actions are driven by wanting to be on the right side of history.

"I guess I wanted to 'get on the board'," said Marissa.  "Like when
our kids, and our grandparents read about us, I want them to know what
we believed in.  I want them to know I was bold and courageous."

"I know what you mean," I said.  "Sometimes while writing a journal, I
feel the need to verbally interact with something big going on, like
the election.  And it feels kind of inorganic, and I wonder if I'm
bringing it up for the wrong reasons.  But I also want to keep a
complete record.  A vivid record."

Marissa, being a curator of both herself and the paintings she makes,
has a choice to make.  She can keep her cards close to the chest,
veering clear of politics and personal convictions.  She can choose to
decouple her personality from her product.  She can hide behind her
gentle smile and her innate Minnesota born niceness, carefully making
herself appealing to people of all political inclinations.

"It's your choice," I said.  "You can avoid talking about it, and sell
more paintings to more types of people - and that would be fine.  Or
you can share what you believe and sacrifice your wider appeal -
that's admirable too."

## Motivations are Complicated

The truth is that there are many reasons to post something on the
Internet.  We can be motivated by a depraved need see someone lose
their composure.  We can be moved by pressure to put our best foot
forward and appear intelligent and cunning for Internet admirers.  But
we can also be moved by a desire to be vulnerable, authentic, and
remembered for who we actually were.

People's motivations aren't discrete.  We're motivated by different
things all at once, and often we act before we get a chance to sort
through the mess.  Sometimes the best we can do is examine our actions
after the fact, and if there are still lingering doubts, just try to
do better next time.
