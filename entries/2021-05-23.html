<h2><code>2019-06-18 Tuesday , vancouver, routine, and sick</code></h2>
<p>Good Morning Journal!</p>
<p>It's been way too long since I've made a journal entry.  I decided not
to make journal entries in Vancouver.  Between the jet lag, sleeping
in, and the beer, and ridiculously delicious food, it was all so
deeply relaxing that it pulled me right out of my routine.  As a
result, I feel a bit like a stranger in my own routine.  I vaguely
remember everything I used to do, and luckily I have it all down in a
schedule, so this morning feels a little weird - like I'm assuming the
identity of someone, following their meticulous instructions.</p>
<p>It doesn't help either that the vacation ended in a really bizarre
way.  The second I got home, I started feeling sick, and by 11 pm I was
hurling my guts up and had the shakes - I think it was the flu.  I
think I still might be getting over it all to be honest.  I'm getting
random headaches and everything I eat or drink makes me just a bit
queasy.  So my hope for today is that I'm going to take it slow, stay
on the tracks, and hopefully my life will start to feel a little
normal again.  I have to say, it feels good to be writing in the ol'
journal again.  While I was cleaning up my documents yesterday, I
couldn't help but be impressed with how magnificent my single file
journal looks now that it spans three months.  But then again, the
several days missing from June bum me out a bit.</p>
<p>Here's a personal challenge.  Next time I take a trip, I need to keep
journaling.  It may take me out of the feeling of deep relaxation that
comes with vacation, but I bet there would be some benefits.  Maybe
entering back into the real world wouldn't be so hard.  Maybe I would
remember more sights and sounds and capture them in a record more
effectively.  That's definitely true, because now all I have is
pictures and a few stories.</p>
<p>OK, let's hit the breaks a bit.  I feel like this entry is a little
negative, and I think the coffee is finally starting to kick in.
Vancouver, in short, was amazing.  Something about the Pacific makes
the food taste so vibrant and fresh.  It was like everything I put in
my mouth had an entirely new dimension of delicious.  The city itself
was kind of an urban exploration wonderland.  Vancouver defied my
expectations in that it was grimy, rebellious, young, loud, and
undeniably cool.  Marissa and I stayed at an AirBNB in the middle of
Gas Town, and on the 40th floor looking out at the city from our shaky
little balcony, I felt like one of those war lords from Mad Max.
Vancouver, in the best way possible, felt a little lawless and very
cool.</p>
<p>The urban wandering and bar hopping was outside of Marissa's comfort
zone (we knew about this from Amsterdam), so we made lots of time to
do more relaxing touristy things as well - going to the aquarium,
biking around Stanley park, going whale watching, taking a cooking
class.  We found a much better system that would have probably saved
us an argument in Amsterdam - Marissa drives the agenda during the
day, and I drive the agenda at night.  Every night, I was able to
convince her to go out past 11PM for a quick beer, and that alone led
to a lot of fun discoveries.</p>
<p>But yeah, Vancouver was amazing.  We joked about how it was a "one
night stand" kind of city, and we'd have little reason to return, but
it's definitely not a city that I'll forget.  Honestly, Vancouver was
a more delicious, darker, more honest San Francisco.  Vancouver is San
Francisco with better beer.  San Francisco with if it hadn't shaved in
a while.  San Francisco, except it's much less insecure.</p>
<p>I'll try to pepper in more stories about Vancouver throughout the week
and tag them accordingly.  In the meantime, I've got other stuff on my
mind.  As I'm writing, I'm mentally barraging myself with things I
need to get done.  I have a feeling that this four day week is going
to feel like a five day week.  I really need to get the ball rolling
with my class reunion, and it looks like it's going to be a pretty
awkwardly small group.  I have a lot of shit to catch up with at work,
like personal goals and writing and all kinds of other nonsense - on
top of our team's main project, which it looks like it may have
pivoted a bit while I was gone.  I trust the team, but I'll still have
to mentally catch up.</p>
<p>I think Zig Zig missed me last week.  She napped on my nap all
yesterday morning.  Then she climbed into bed with me last night while
Marissa was still working in the studio.  I woke up to her nose
pressed against my face.  For how weird it is to get back into things,
that's the best possible way to start off your day.</p>
<p>Alright - it's 7:30.  That means go time.  The name of the game is
"fake it til you make it".</p>
<h2><code>2019-06-23 Sunday</code></h2>
<p>Good Morning Journal!</p>
<p>It's a beautiful quiet Sunday, and I've got plenty of good food in my
stomach.  The ribs turned out pretty good, but I used too much
charcoal in the grill, so I pretty much had to baby sit the
temperature until they were done.  I'm pretty exhausted today.  The
cornbread really stole the show though.  It turned out absolutely
perfect.  And additionally, I learned that you can make it the night
before and stick it in the fridge and it still turns out amazing (if
not even better than baking it fresh).  After dinner, we met up with
Alex and Cassie that that new beer place getting built in the union
corners.  It was pretty cool.  The beer was tasty, and they had a few
really interesting ice cream flavors.  I still have a hard time
thinking about the union corners as a place to hang out - it's
basically been a giant abandoned field for as long as we lived there,
and even know you have to walk through a field and the UW clinic
parking lot to get there.  Still, it's encouraging to see the
neighborhood changing in a positive (albeit wealthier direction).
Gentrification sucks, but being able to bar hop at places on the same
street as you is pretty cool too.  It will be interesting to see how
this affects our street.  It's still pretty much old people, rented
houses, and other eccentric types.</p>
<p>Today we're going to church, then heading straight home for some
leftovers.  Marissa was supposed to have a painting class today on the
patio of Karben 4, but there's a lot of rain in the forecast, so the
contingency plan is to reschedule and put on a private lesson at our
place for the few people that are driving from out of state.  I'm
hoping to catch up on some chores and tasks.  I'd like to finally
finish Kelly's laptop, write a letter back to Maya, and finally catch
up on emails.  I've also been getting the itch to work on some code.
Not sure what, but I'm not letting myself jump into anything new
before I clear my TODO list.</p>
<p>Well, I'm starting to hear Rodney stir.  I better go get him.  Let's
have a productive Sunday!</p>
