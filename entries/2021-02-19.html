<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.  Happy Friday.  The weekend is so close now.
It's just on the other side of this measly little Friday.  I know we'd
all just rather just crawl back in bed.  Maybe grab a snack on the way
up and watch Netflix until you either fall asleep or get hungry enough
to leave the room again.  But how about we just get on with it just
this once, for old time's sake?</p>
<p>Snacks and Netflix in bed.  That sounds pretty good right about now,
doesn't it? I remember in college when I was home for the summer, my
favorite move was to pickup a big bag of White Castle or Taco Bell and
just chip away at it all day from the couch.  White Castle is
especially good for that.  The way those little cheese burgers stack
together in the bag create this very efficient distribution of heat.
Like a steamy, onion-ey chimney.</p>
<p>Did you just retch a little when you read the words <em>White Castle</em>?
That's understandable.  Most people I talk to are revolted by them.
Those little greasy cheese burgers are an acquired taste.  But if
someday you get curious enough to try one, you'll probably have the
best experience if you have at least a little beer in your stomach
from the night before.  Otherwise, hate all you want - I come from a
long line of proud White Castle eaters, and we will not be
intimidated.</p>

<p><em>Sip</em>.  So how's it going today?  How was your week?  By now, my
complaints about the work week have been numerous, haven't they?  Work
has been a struggle - a slog.  My role has become so stressful and
confusing that I pine for the days where I used to sign on for the day
and just work on something.  I used to hunt for bugs in code.  I used
to spend all day trying to figure out why two servers couldn't talk to
each other.  What a blessing that was.  These days, that work is like
a dessert.  I only get it in small portions, and I have to earn it
first.  I have to carve the time out of my calendar and defend it.</p>
<p>As the day went on, I tried to get out of my head more often.  I took
my nervous bedroom pacing downstairs, turning them into little trips
to refill coffee and see what Rodney and Marissa were up to.  They
regaled me with stories of their big trip to the pet store to buy
replace the broken heater in the fish tank.  Rodney met some hungry
fish in a koi pond.  He also met a talking bird.</p>
<p>"What did he sound like?" I asked.</p>
<p>Rodney squared his feet and took a deep breath.  "He sounds
like... <em>haaLLLOOOOO?</em>  <em>TREEEEeeeat?</em>"  His impression of the talking
bird put a smile on my face.  Marissa and I coaxed him to perform it
several more times that day.</p>
<p>Marissa and I have noticed what a difference being out makes on
Rodney.  He carries himself differently.  He's happier.  He acts
older.  After running a simple errand out in the real world, he even
speaks more clearly.</p>
<p>"And he's so good at the rules," said Marissa.  "He wore two masks
with me, since that's what they recommend now.  And when we were
turning the corner of an aisle he said <em>Ope, there's people, momma.
We gotta go around</em>."</p>
<p>That may be a tough habit to break someday.  You have to wonder how
many kids his age are going to spend the rest of their lives
instinctively staying six feet apart from strangers, even after
they've forgotten why.</p>
<p>Marissa and I decided to prioritize taking trips with Rodney.  I think
he needs the stimulation and the sense of purpose.  I'm taking him to
Hy-Vee later today to pick up stuff to make pizza, and just between
you and me I'm planning on buying him literally everything he points
at.  Hot Wheels cars.  Bouncy balls.  Chocolate eggs.  Everything is
fair game.  We're going to be like contestants on that old game show
where people had to fill a grocery cart as quickly as possible.  What
was that game again?</p>
<p>We picked up Portillo's for dinner.  In very poor planning, I slammed
a whole diet coke just before my scheduled nap slot, and consequently
I spent the whole time just staring up at the ceiling thinking about
work.  Even though I didn't sleep, it was still a relief to just
think.  I feel like I spend most of the day talking to people, and I'm
not one of those people that can process thoughts through talking
about them.  In the silence of our dark bedroom, I just thought,
prayed, and reflected about everything.</p>
<p>Marissa swooped in and finished my chores for the evening.  "I felt
bad for you and I didn't know how else to help."  After exercise,
Dutch practice, and getting Rodney to bed, what a treat it was to just
crumple on the couch with my laptop!</p>
<p>Thanks to Marissa's house-keeping heroics, I was able to get some more
time on <em>shmeeds</em>, my tool for posting journal entries to social
media.  Last night I finished a subcommand to fetch the latest entry.</p>
<p><code>$ shmeeds latest

<p>What a fun little python project.  Feel free to follow along on my
<a href="https://github.com/arecker/shmeeds">github</a> as it takes shape.  In the next stage of the project, I'll
add functionality to post to slack and twitter.  This is pretty easy -
both slack and twitter have very reasonable APIs that can get this
done.</p>
<p>But Facebook?  Bleh.  They have an API, but the only way to use it is
if you either register for a business or mail some identifying
documents to them for manual review (as if they don't know enough
about me already - what a joke!).  And by the way, that department is
closed right now because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>For the trouble of making a simple post to Facebook, I'm going to have
to teach <em>shmeeds</em> how to do it the old fashion way.  It will open a
web browser, go punch in <em>facebook-dot-com</em> into the address bar, and
make all the same clicks that I do every day.</p>
<p>Also, I've decided to bag the Friday retros.  I noticed I was saying
the same thing every week.  First "joke of the week" took a nose dive,
and now Friday retros.  I gotta figure out what to do on Fridays, but
for now as a temporary measure we'll just call them "TBD Fridays".
Thanks for stopping by, everyone.  Have a great day today.</p>
