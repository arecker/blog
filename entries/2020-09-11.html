<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone.  Happy <em>vrijdag</em>.  Glorious Friday.  Perfect Friday.  The vanquisher of the work week.  The golden gates open, ushering us into a blissful realm of naps, TV, beer, and football.</p>
<p>How is everyone doing today?  I'm feeling good today, but I shouldn't have taken my cup of coffee in the shower.  Every time I do that, I start day dreaming and end up taking too long to get ready in the morning.  As I write, I have one eye on this paragraph and the other on the little digital clock in the corner of my computer screen.  I have just shy of an hour to crank out this blog post and jump online for an early morning riveting session of story backlog grooming with my team.</p>
<p>As you might remember, I came back from paternity leave to a team that was twice its size since I left.  The new faces and personalities in our dynamic overwhelmed me at first, but like most people I work with, they're kind, knowledgeable, focused, and they can crack a joke.  Dakota, Anthony, Brook, Sathish, and Dang, I'm glad you're on the team.</p>
<p>And if there existed the perfect day to familiarize myself with our new teammates, it was yesterday.  I jumped online at my regular time with a cup of coffee in hand ready to put on some music, go over my calendar, and prune my personal notes for the day.  That's when I noticed a single giant meeting spanning the entire day, starting fifteen minutes ago.</p>
<p>It's complicated.  But our team decided to pivot on a project we were working on, and to sum up we had a lot to figure out in a very short amount of time.  The meeting was a <em>zoom bridge</em> - our term for a placeholder meeting room that allows people to drift in and out as we work on a single goal.</p>
<p>We adjourned for lunch time.  I joined Marissa and Rodney in the kitchen.</p>
<p>"What's going on up there?" asked Marissa.  "Is everything OK?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, everything is good," I chuckled wearily.  "Just work stuff.  But I am in that meeting pretty much all day, and we have a lot to do."</p>
<p>"You can have the soup," said Marissa without hesitating.</p>
<p>"Oh thank God," I sighed.  "You are a saint."  I was secretly hoping I could lay claim to our single serving of squash soup in the fridge.  Talking, listening, explaining, visualizing, asking questions - after four hours, my brain was tired.  I felt like a battered prize fighter clinging to the ropes in my corner, hoping for a second wind.  Carrying a bowl of soup, a few <em>stukjes brood</em>, and the remainder of a little can of herring in white wine sauce that was languishing in the back of our fridge, I trudged back up the stairs.</p>
<p>Marissa grabbed my arm just before I disappeared into my office.</p>
<p>"Did you see what Rodney did in his room?" she laughed.</p>
<p>"No what?" I said, smiling.</p>
<p>"Come here - let me show you," she said, leading me across the hallway.  I peered into his room.  At first, nothing caught my eye.  K'nex pieces lying on the floor.  Old tattered issues of <em>Highlights</em> lying on his bed.  And then I saw it - the face.</p>

<p>I jumped.  "AH!  Oh wow, that's something."</p>
<p>"Rodney drew it," smiled Marissa.</p>
<p>There on his little whiteboard was a giant face.  The top and sides of the bulbous, lumpy head touched the edges of the wood frame.  Two misshapen eyes with silly little pupils rolling in different directions.  A single black dot for a nose, and a big smarmy smirk from cheek to cheek.  I also counted <em>three</em> ears.</p>
<p>"DADA I DREW IT," said Rodney.  "It's MEEEEEEEE."  Rodney slid into the hallway, his arms spread wide.</p>
<p>"Dude that's awesome," I said, congratulating him.  He scampered away, leaving Marissa and I in his room.  We lingered a little longer, admiring the face like a piece of art.</p>
<p>"It's hard to explain why it's so unsettling," I said.</p>
<p>"Oh I know," said Marissa.  "Yet I can't look away."</p>
<p>"I think it's because... it's so far the most complete thing to come directly out of his brain?  I mean, it's the first time he's ever really drawn anything like this - a glimpse into how his brain works.  It's amusing, but it's also kind of startling, like seeing a stranger in your house."</p>
<p>I wolfed down my lunch at my desk, the rejoined our meeting.  Amidst the continued planning and discussions, Rodney's silly whiteboard face lurked in the back of my memory.  A few times, I even had to mute my microphone so my team wouldn't hear me seemingly laugh at nothing.</p>
<p>Our team was tired.  Spending the entire day in discussion together, we all looked like we were ready to shut our brains off for a while.  "See ya tomorrow, teamies - nice work today," I said before signing off.  I happily shut my laptop and started on dinner.  I made ragout, this time with chuck roast.  Seared beef, carrots, potato, and I also completely cleared out what was left in our shelf of onions and shallots.</p>
<p>"Thanks for cooking today," said Marissa.  "I was expecting you to shoot me a slack with your pizza order."</p>
<p>"Oh it's no problem - I felt like cooking," I said.  Truthfully, it was such a long day - on top of a long week - that a pizza wasn't going to cut it.  My tired brain demanded stew.  I needed <em>ragout</em>.</p>

<p>"Dada, what's this?" said Rodney, stabbing at a slice of purple carrot.</p>
<p>"That's a carrot, dude," I replied.  "The carrots I used today were different colors.  There was a yellow one, a red one, and that's a purple one."</p>
<p>"They're really cool," said Marissa.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I like how they kind trick you into thinking there's more vegetables in here," I laughed.</p>
<p>I put Rodney to bed.  We read the story <em>Llama LLama, Red Pajama</em>, and I was so tired that after the last page, I said "amen".  Rodney shot me a confused look.</p>
<p>"Sorry dude - I don't know why I thought we were praying," I laughed.  "Now let's actually do prayers."</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by today.  Have a wonderful day today.</p>
