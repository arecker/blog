<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  I hope this Sunday is treating you well, and that you get one last thorough day of rest before going back to work tomorrow.  I'm having a wonderful morning so far.  Not only is our coffee filling me with all kinds of energy today, but I've also successfully waited out Rodney's morning Blippi binge.  A moment ago, he grew tired of watching Blippi on the living room TV and relocated himself to the dining room for some quiet computer games.  So here's to having a quiet living room to myself.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em>.  Well I'm happy to report that I finally feel <em>caught up</em> in the chores department.  Yesterday, after publishing my morning entry, I affixed my cleaning apron and became a one man housework hurricane, all while roasting some Brussels sprouts and finishing up a fresh loaf of bread.  This batch had a few generous scoops of grapeseed oil mixed into the dough, which did amazing things for the texture and the flavor.</p>
<p>"Ooh, look at you," said Marissa passing through the kitchen.  "This is fancy."</p>
<p>I had figured out how to use painter's tape along the top of the loaf pan as sort of a flour stencil.  After letting the loaf cool down, I made some grilled cheese sandwiches, and we enjoyed lunch together on the back porch.</p>
<p>After an afternoon nap, Rodney and I sneaked passed a sleeping Marissa and Miles to leave for Hy-Vee.  But on the way, we were diverted off the main road by police cars.</p>
<p>"Uh oh, dude.  I think this intersection is closed down," I said, craning my neck to see over the parked cop cars.  "I don't know how to get around this, we might be a little lost."</p>
<p>"We're lost?!" exclaimed Rodney.</p>
<p>"Just a little bit lost," I laughed, trying to ease his sudden worry.  We burned up twenty minutes of shopping time trying to find a detour.  After we had parked, I flicked through my Twitter feed to see what all the mess was about.</p>
<p>"Ah," I said to Rodney from the front seat.  "It's protesters.  Too bad we didn't get to see any of it up close - we were turned away a block before.  I see why that picked that intersection, that was really hard to get around."</p>
<p>Rodney and I picked up groceries.  Circling the frozen aisle, Rodney fixed his gaze on a large wire rack filled with colorful inflatable balls.</p>
<p>"Dada!  Dada!" Rodney said, his eyes bulging wide above his tiny face mask.  As soon as he had my attention, he took a more diplomatic tone.</p>
<p>"Dada, I get a red ball?  Zig Zig popped my ball."  He folded his arms, waiting for a reply.</p>
<p>"That's true," I said.  "Ziggy popped your old one.  That was a real bummer.  I'll make a deal with you."</p>
<p>Rodney raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>"You can pick out one ball, but no chocolate egg," I continued.</p>
<p>"But a marshmallow later?  Later?" asked Rodney, amending the conditions.</p>
<p>"Sure," I sighed.  "You can have a marshmallow.  That's fair.</p>
<p>After paying for our groceries and heading home, I quickly started on dinner.  I made a shrimp paella yesterday.</p>
<p>"I've never had paella," said Marissa.</p>
<p>"Neither have I," I replied, looking up from chopping an onion.  "I've never made it, and I don't think I've ever had it."</p>
<p>And from what I know about paella, it's a fun meal to throw together.  On a tip from Chef John, I boosted the flavor on the store-bought chicken stock by simmering some shrimp shells.  The rest of the dish sort of felt like a Spanish pilaf - sausage, vegetables, and spices in first, followed by a cup of rice, then the stock.  Lastly, I arranged a pound of shrimp on top of the dish before leaving it in the oven to cook.</p>
<p>"It's spicy," whined Rodney as we ate on the back porch.  His sippie cup of milk was already slurped clean.</p>
<p>"It's not <em>that</em> spicy," I replied curtly.  "Just eat it, dude.  Spicy food is good for your tummy."</p>
<p>"What do you think," said Marissa, "you're just going to eat <em>crappy</em> bars and mac 'n cheese your whole life?"</p>
<p>"Oh I bet he'd like that," I added.  "Dude, you gotta keep your stomach on your toes."  Marissa looked at me, wrinkling her nose with a little laugh as Rodney dug his fork back into his paella.</p>
<p>"So I did a terrible job shopping," I said with a smirk to Marissa.  "I... didn't get <em>anything</em> for our anniversary tomorrow.  I think I was really thrown off finding a way around the protest."</p>
<p>"Oh it's OK," said Marissa.</p>
<p>"No steak and champagne, but... you can get <em>really excited</em> about..."  I rolled my fingers on the edge of the table, making a drum roll.</p>
<p>"Leftover paella and beeeeeer!" I raised my hands over my head in feigned enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"That sounds pretty good too," said Marissa.</p>
<p>After Rodney had finished his dinner, he ran inside to grab his new ball.  "Oh Dada," said Marissa.  "We have to show you a new game we made up while I was mowing the lawn.  Rodney, tell dada what it's called."</p>
<p>"BEACH!" shouted Rodney.</p>
<p>"Beach?" I echoed.</p>
<p>"<em>BEACH</em>" he yelled, kicking his bare feet to emphasize his point.</p>
<p>"OK, take me through it, kids," I said squaring my stance in the grass.  "How do you play beach?"</p>
<p>Rodney raised his hand to his mouth.  "BEACH!" he shouted.</p>
<p>"BEACH!" Marissa shouted.  Both turned toward me.</p>
<p>"... BEACH!" I yelled.  Rodney threw the ball to Marissa, and she bumped it in my direction.</p>
<p>"So it's just catch - or volleyball," I laughed, scooping the ball up from under the lawn chair.  "Only you yell... <em>beach</em>"</p>
<p>"BEACH!" yelled Rodney.</p>
<p>"BEACH!" yelled Marissa.</p>
<p>"BEACHHHHHHH," I yelled hitting it to Rodney.</p>
<p>As I put Rodney to bed, the three of us continued to shout <em>BEACH</em> throughout the house, and I even heard a few more from Rodney's darkened room later that evening.  Marissa and I shared a beer on the porch and chatted.</p>
<p>"It feels like we packed a lot in six years of marriage," I laughed.  "And six years doesn't even sound like that much time.  We're not even close to, say, Jean Valjean's prison sentence."</p>
<p>Marissa laughed.  "Prison sentence?" she asked, pretending to get angry.</p>
<p>"Just time wise," I said, pretending to nervously back peddle.  "You know, just finding something to compare it to."</p>
<p>Marissa smiled.  "Best six years of my life."</p>
<p>"Me too," I said.</p>
<p>Marissa, thanks for being married to me.  I'm lucky to have found you, and it has been so fulfilling learning to love you better and growing a family together.  I love you.</p>
