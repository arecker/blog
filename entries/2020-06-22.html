<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Monday.  I hope you had a restful
weekend, and that you found time to call all the dads in your life.  I
had a wonderful father's day, and the proof of that is evident in how
messy the house is this morning.  With Marissa assuming double kid
duty, running interference for Rodney pretty much all day, I leaned
into the preferential treatment and spent most of the day shirking my
responsibilities, snacking and lounging around isntead.  I think
yesterday, the most arduous task I accomplished was making a pair of
grilled cheese sandwiches in the kitchen.`</p>
<p>"I'll leave you the rest of the leftover chicken," I said to Marissa
as we ate lunch together on the back porch.</p>
<p>"Actually," she replied hesitantly, "would you make another grilled
cheese for me?"</p>
<p>"Rissa - " I said springing up to my feet.  "I'll make you a grilled
cheese anytime you ask.  That's my personal code.  You could roll me
over in the middle of the night after a night of heavy drinking, and
I'd <em>still</em> make you a heckin' grilled cheese."  My voice trailed off
as the back door snapped shut behind me.</p>
<p>Later, while calling my dad to wish him a happy father's day, he
helped set the record straight with the story I told about him in
<a href="/2020-06-21.html">yesterday's entry</a>.</p>
<p>"It was near Bloomington," he said.  "The shipping charges were in
excess of 300 bucks, so I decided to drive the speakers the 3 hours
and pocket the shipping."</p>
<p>"So technically, we never left Illinois - it just figures that I had
no idea where we were," I laughed.</p>
<p>I guess whenever I tell a story about my childhood, if there's any
part of the context that involves geography, take that with a grain of
salt.  There was another time where I was reminiscing with Marissa
bout a summer camp I used to attend called <em>Camp Manitoqua</em>.</p>
<p>"Where was it located?" asked my wife.</p>
<p>"Oh it was like way out in the boonies," I replied.  "I think it was
in like northern Wisconsin, or maybe even like Michigan?  I just
remember it being so dark at night, you couldn't even see your hand in
front of your face.  And there were thousands of stars in the night
sky.  It felt like the real wilderness."</p>
<p>"Let's look it up," said Marissa.  "Maybe you and Rodney can do a
father-son weekend or something."  Marissa opened a browser tab to
Google maps and punched in the name of the camp.  The screen zoomed in
on a bright red pin.</p>
<p>"Camp Manitoqua, there it is," I said pointing at the screen.</p>
<p>"It's... in Chicago, hon," said Marissa.  "Look, it's just south of
Tinley Park."  We both broke out into laughter.</p>

<p>So I'm not a natural navigator.  I think as I kid, I wasn't naturally
observant, and I was also unlucky enough to grow up in a time where
only observant people could get where they needed to go.  I would have
thrived nowadays, where smartphones are so good that email addresses,
phone numbers, and locations are just second hand information scraped
from a quick google search.</p>
<p>For dinner, we ordered from my favorite Chinese restaurant, setting up
on the couch in weekend style with a feast of orange chicken, fried
rice, egg rolls, and crab rangoons.</p>
<p>"What are we watching, daddy?  You get TV pick," said Marissa.</p>
<p>"How boooooout... Blippi," said Rodney.</p>
<p>"How about a <em>movie</em>," I said.  I scrolled through our movie and found
the original Willy Wonka movie.  "Rod - have you ever seen this movie?
This is one of my favorites - you're going to love it."</p>
<p>The movie immediately lured us in.  Rodney stared as the screen in
wonder.  And in the <em>I have a Golden Ticket</em> number where Grandpa Joe
sprung out of his bed to dance with Charlie, Rodney clapped his hangs
and tapped his toe with glee.</p>
<p>It was a smooth, family friendly ride until we got to the
first... um... factory accident.  We arrived at the scene where August
Gloop greedily drinks with his hands from the chocolate river.  Rodney
was so anxious he stopped chewing.  A long lo mein noodle hung from
his mouth while he stared at the screen without blinking.</p>
<p>And then Augustus Gloop rolled into the river.  His mother shrieked,
and all that was seen of him were some frantic bubbles beneath the
brown surface.  Rodney's face welled with tears and he began to cry.</p>
<p>"Oh dude, I got you," I said, letting him crawl into my lap.  "What's
wrong... too scary?"</p>
<p>"YEAH" said Rodney, wailing.  "TOO SCARY."</p>
<p>"They're just joking around, dude," said Marissa.  "Look, if we keep
watching, he's going to shoot out of the tube."</p>
<p>"They're just joking around," I repeated.  Rodney sheepishly looked at
the screen, peeking one eye out from underneath my tight embrace.</p>
<p>"Just joking around," Rodney repeated, quietly.  "It's pretty scary
though."</p>
<p>"I think we're all done with this movie," I said.  "I was feeling like
a walk anyway.  Let's go get some icecream."</p>
<p>Marissa and I finished the movie after Rodney went to bed.  Together,
we watched the scene where Wonka takes them on a boat ride through the
tunnel.  Wonka's bizarre song grows to a fierce and maniacal battle
cry.  The children scream as visions of spiders and worms flicker on
the dark cave walls.</p>
<p>"So what do you think of the movie, Rodney?" I laughed, pretending
Rodney was beside me.</p>
<p>"This would have been a disaster," said Marissa.  "I'm glad he stopped
watching so early in the movie.  Was it a mistake to watch this?"</p>
<p>"It's rated G!" I exclaimed.  "We watched this when we were kids.  And
I really liked it.  I remember hating the boat cave scene, but I still
admired it and I couldn't look away."</p>
<p>"Isn't it funny," added Marissa.  "The new movie has CGI and more back
story, but it's still not nearly as scary as this version.  And it
doesn't suck you in as much."</p>
<p>"It's because CGI isn't a replacement for <em>gravitas</em>," I said.</p>
<p>This morning, I was curious about the song Wonka sings while taking
the children through the dark boat cave.  So I looked up the lyrics:</p>
<p>``` text
There's no earthly way of knowing
Which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're rowing
Or which way the river's flowing</p>
<p>Is it raining, is it snowing?
Is a hurricane a-blowing?</p>
<p>Not a speck of light is showing
So the danger must be growing
Are the fires of Hell a-glowing?
Is the grisly Reaper mowing?</p>
<p>Yes! The danger must be growing
For the rowers keep on rowing
And they're certainly not showing
Any signs that they are slowing
```</p>
<p>Let me remind you that this movie is rated <em>G</em>.  They certainly don't
make movies the way they used to, huh?  Thanks for stopping by this
morning - I hope you have a wonderful day.</p>
