<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>It's knife sharpening day.  About once a month, I take out my whetstone from the little corner of my kitchen counter and plunk it in a loaf pan filled with water.  For some reason unknown to me, the square block bubbles under the surface of the liquid.  After a minute or so, the bubbles stop, and that's my cue to remove the stone and begin with the first knife.  I place the stone on a wet rag to keep it from slipping.</p>
<p>There are two sides marked with different color gradients.  One is "1000", the other is "300", and without fail I need to google the difference every time I do this monthly chore.  The numbers are the grit, and 1000 is just about right for home use.  I think I would only need the "300" side if I was repairing an old sword or something.  Good to know.</p>
<p>Holding the blade carefully with the pads of my fingers, I sweep each knife across the top of the whetstone.  It's tricky keeping the right angle and covering the whole length of the blade - hilt to tip.</p>
<p>It makes a pretty cool sound.  The loud metallic scraping sounds like it belongs in the beginning montage of an 80s action movie.
<em>Meanwhile, our hero remains stranded in remote Cambodia, and you could say he has an "axe to grind".</em></p>
<p>Once I've done each side of the blade, I give it a few careful runs with the honing rod.  I've done this part so often that I can feel when it's finished.  There's a moment when the blade is "honed" that the honing rod loses grip, and the knife slides more freely.</p>
<p>When I've finished a knife, I lay it in the sink until I've sharpened the others.  Than out of fear of getting microscopic metal shavings in my food, I give them all a thorough clean with soap and a sponge.</p>
<p>They say the way you can test if a knife is completely sharpened is if it can cut a piece of paper.  Personally, I find this test frustrating, and it makes me feel inadequate - especially after all that work.  I like the finger nail test.  If a knife is sharp enough - sharp enough for my standards - you should be able to shave off your finger nail as if you were whittling a piece of wood.</p>
<p>I pat the knives dry with a towel before hanging them up again.  Sometimes I rub some mineral oil on my favorite paring knife, which gets special treatment.</p>

<p><em>Sip</em>.  Good morning, everyone.  How is your Wednesday going?  We've had a quiet week here.  I'm pleased with how much I'm getting done at work.  This week I've found a good balance between opening and closing my various social channels.  Lately, I prefer solitary mornings.  I close slack and email, and riding the caffeine rush of a whole pot of coffee, I write code until lunch time.  Chatting with Marissa and Rodney at the table over lunch gently shakes me into a different head space, where I feel a little more friendly and outgoing.  In the afternoons, I catch up on what the rest of the team is doing, I read company news, and I help out with reviewing code.</p>
<p>And there's no better way to end the work day than with a power nap.  While Marissa was starting to prepare dinner, I climbed onto the couch yesterday for a half hour snooze.  I awoke to the smell of ground beef, and to the sound of Rodney thumping things around his room.</p>
<p>"I'll get him out of quiet time," I called into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Rodney and I do science class before dinner on Tuesdays.  "Are you excited to do some science?" I asked, while changing him.</p>
<p>"What are we doing today?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Something with baking soda and vinegar," I chuckled.  "I haven't worked out the details yet."</p>
<p>Last week's lesson about dissolving things in liquid I found had just a little too much theory and not enough demonstration.  Which is why this week, my plan was to just focus on the pyrotechnics.</p>
<p>"Hey Momma, do you know where the balloons are?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oh Rodney knows," laughed Marissa.  "That's his favorite thing to get out of the basement.</p>
<p>Surprised, I turned to Rodney.  "Can you help me find the balloons, dude?"</p>
<p>"Sure!  This way," said Rodney, taking careful steps down the basement stairs.  Rodney led me between stack boxes, over folded cardboard, and between paintings.</p>
<p>"Dada," he said turning around in his tracks.  "Don't touch the paintings."  He held his finger up and locked eyes to make sure I was taking it as seriously as he.</p>
<p>"Don't touch the paintings - got it," I repeated obediently.</p>
<p>Rodney guided me into the back corner of the basement, first expertly navigating around some stored agility equipment.  "Just step, then do a HOP," said Rodney, guiding me like a little basement clutter sherpa.</p>
<p>"The balloons are up there," he pointed.  "Can I have <em>two</em> this time?"</p>
<p>Without answering, I reached into the bin and grabbed the whole bag.  Rodney began to convulse with excitement.  We made our way outside for our science experiment.</p>
<p>"What's this stuff," I asked pouring out some baking soda into tupperware on the deck.</p>
<p>"That's DIRTY SAUCE," he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Very funny," I said rolling my eyes.</p>
<p>"It's sugar," said Rodney more seriously.</p>
<p>"Close - it's baking soda.  Check this out, dude," I said.  I added a splash of vinegar and swirled.  It made foam bubbles that reached the top of the container, met from Rodney some very literal <em>ooh</em>'s and
<em>aah</em>'s.</p>
<p>"That's <em>gas</em>," I narrated.  "Do you know how we can prove it?  Watch this dude."  Together we scooped some baking soda into a balloon, and stretched it over a plastic watter bottle loaded with more vinegar.  We made our way out to the yard.  I shook the bottle and threw it, expecting an explosion.  The balloon swelled up, but didn't pop.</p>
<p>"WOAHHHHH," said Rodney.  "LET'S GOOO."</p>
<p>"Check it out dude, feel it.  Is it hot or cold?"</p>
<p>Rodney wandered over to the balloon and scooped it off the floor.  "It's cold," he said, surprised.  "So chilly."</p>
<p>Baking soda and vinegar is an endothermic reaction, meaning it consumes energy from the rest of the system, making the solution and the balloon cool to the touch.  I had forgotten about part.</p>
<p>For the remainder of "science class", we filled up some more balloons.  Rodney chased them around the yard with a baseball bat.  Very academic stuff, right?</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by today.  I hope you have a wonderful day today.</p>
