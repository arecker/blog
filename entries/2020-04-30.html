<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  From my flickering computer screen to yours, I'd like to wish you a happy Thursday.  Congratulations on making it this far in the work week.</p>
<p>Rodney surprised me this morning.  Normally he sleeps until about 9 or 9:30, but today as I was sleepily preparing the first pot of coffee in the kitchen, I heard him making exuberant <em>WOOP WOOP</em> noises from his upstairs bedroom.  So I speedily sequestered him to the downstairs couch and set him up with Dinotrux while I finished getting ready for the day.  I don't blame him.  The rain had him cooped up indoors for most of the day yesterday.  Spending that much time indoors might make you want to spring out of bed a little earlier, and have a productive morning playing with plastic tools and taking in some quiet, relaxing dinosaur truck drama.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em> - I had a nice day of work yesterday.  The no-meetings thing was pretty great.  I had plenty of time to catch up on reading communications, organize some of my notes, and fix the script that I had botched the day before.  I was feeling pretty good heading into my lunch break.  Marissa, Rodney, and I gathered around the dining room table to heat up some leftovers.</p>
<p>"So I found an old essay you wrote for my old blog," I said to Marissa.  "Do you remember writing that?  It was called <a href="https://archive.alexrecker.com/the-top-5-ways-that-my-corgi-has-taught-me-how-to-be-a-better-person.html">The Top 5 Ways That My Corgi Has Taught Me How to Be a Better Person</a>."</p>
<p>Marissa nodded.  "Yeah I remember writing that.  Please don't..."  But I had already begun to read it aloud at the table.  I read the first paragraph with my best impression of a studious, collegiate Marissa, but the sincerity of the essay pulled me out of character, and before long, I was just letting the content do all the talking.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to keep reading?" I asked, pausing, looking up at the table.</p>
<p>"Actually, yeah - I'm kind of enjoying this.  I'm not cringing as hard as I thought I would," said Marissa.</p>
<p>"It's really well-written.  It's very analytical, and you could tell that you had the makings of a dog trainer.  It's like witnessing the birth of a new passion," I added.</p>
<p>I finished the essay, and we paused for a moment to take it in.  "You put a lot of work into this," I said.  "It sounds like something you would have written for school."</p>
<p>"I was smarter back then," she laughed.</p>
<p>I finished out the work day, and around quitting time, I lured Rodney out of his room to go start on dinner.  "Dude," I said following him down the stairs.  "Do you want to help me make gnocchi?"</p>
<p>After quietly filing past a napping Marissa into the kitchen, Rodney and I got to work.  We stabbed some sweet potatoes with butter knives and popped them in the microwave.  Next, I set him up with making salt water in the stock pot.  I instructed Rodney to add the kosher salt one small pinch at a time.  We would eventually need about a full cup, but letting him work on it in small increments kept him interested longer, and bought me some time to finish making the dough - warm sweet potato filling, a spoonful of ricotta cheese, and flour.</p>
<p>Rodney lost interest in my saltwater diversion, and seeing that I was getting ready to take out the eggs, he scooted his ladder over to the opposite counter, ready to help.  We cracked an egg into a bowl, and Rodney immediately plunged his tiny finger into the yolk, bringing a dollop of raw egg to his mouth for a sample.</p>
<p>"Is it tasty?" I asked, trying to hide my look of horror.  Rodney licked his finger clean and nodded.  "So you like raw eggs - nice one
<em>Rocky</em>," I laughed.</p>
<p>I rolled the dough onto the table and we got to making gnocchi.  I cut Rodney a piece off the dough ball to play with, and I got to work on mine - focusing on gently rolling the dough out into a long snake.  By the time I was slicing my roll up into small doughy pillows, I was surprised to find that Rodney had copied me exactly, rolling a long snake with his own piece of dough.</p>
<p>"Dude - that's awesome.  You picked up on that quick.  Here, why don't you cut them and add them to the pile."  I handed Rodney the bench scraper, and with careful precision, he cut the rope of dough into evenly sized pieces.</p>
<p>As we worked, it became abundantly obvious why the recipe we were following emphasized thoroughly mashing the sweet potatoes before rolling it into a dough.  We found several awkward pieces of unmashed potato in our ropes, which complicated things a bit.  "It's a chunky!"  I yelled, setting it aside.  Rodney happily joined, and our catch phrase <em>It's a chunky!</em> reverberated through the house.</p>
<p>Rodney played with his toys while I finished dinner.  We had the gnocchi with bacon herb butter, and soon we were sitting around the table quiet, content, and on the precipice of a carb induced sleep.  I shook off the tiredness with some chores in the kitchen.  Afterwards, we put Rodney to bed, and Marissa and I made our way to the bedroom for a remote hangout with Ben and Beth, some good friends of ours from college.</p>
<p>"So what kind of bread are you making," asked Ben with a wry smile.</p>
<p>"So you're a bread making weirdo too - why am I not surprised?" I laughed.  We got to talking, and Ben shared some tips for making a sourdough starter.  He explained that unbleached flour was ideal because it still had natural yeast living in it.  "King Arthur flour is probably the best, I would keep an eye out for it," he continued.</p>
<p>We continued chatting, talking about kids, work, managing things at home, and after wrapping up for the night, I returned to the kitchen to finish cleaning up.  All the while, Ben's explanation of yeast and unbleached flour lingered in my mind.  Then suddenly, I was struck by realization.</p>
<p>"The civil war flour!" I said to myself.  Marissa, who was painting at the dining room table looked up at me.</p>
<p>"I still have a bag of that civil war flour!" I repeated.  "I think it's unbleached.  I can make a starter."  I dashed up the kitchen step ladder and rifled through supplies, finding the orange bag tucked against the back wall.</p>
<p>"Look - it's even King Arthur.  Man, I feel bad about ragging on this stuff now," I laughed.</p>
<p>"I'm impressed that you kept it!" added Marissa.  "Make sure you thank Ben for the tip."</p>
<p>Thanks for the bread tip, Ben.  And thank you, reader, for stopping by this morning.  I hope you have a wonderful day.</p>
