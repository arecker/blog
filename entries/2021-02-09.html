<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everybody.  Happy Tuesday.  Shout-out to the Thinkpad,
an instant classic of a Christmas present.  Ever since I applied a
little piece of electrical tape to the battery, it's been nothing but
smooth sailing.  It's light and easy to schlep around the house while
I write in the mornings.  The screen is bright and easy to read.  The
keyboard is crisp and responsive.  It's an instant classic.</p>
<p>Hope you're feeling cozy today.  This morning I've occupied Ziggy's
favorite chair in the living room, which has both her favorite pillow
and her favorite plaid blue arranged in her favorite way.  Last time I
checked on her, she was still in bed crumpled under two and a half
blankets, and even though she would be annoyed to find me sitting
here, I think we're safe for the sixty minutes it takes to write a
journal entry.  That goes to say if this entry trails off mid
sentence, then you can guess what my fate was.</p>
<p>I kid.  Ziggy wouldn't hurt a fly, and she's actually a baby - a big,
pretty baby.  These days she has a spring in her step, almost like she
knows we've already committed to getting a new puppy.  Her sister
already gave birth to a beautiful litter in Philadelphia.  We're on
the list.  The wheels are in motion.  We're planning an obscenely long
road trip to pick up the puppy.  I don't think the drive from
Wisconsin to Philadelphia will be packed with excitement, but I have
to admit that the thought of leaving this house for so long and
driving to a new place gives me a sense of adventure.  If anything
that will be an interesting set of journals to look back on.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em>.  How are you feeling today?  Do you also have puppy fever, or
are you set with your crew?  More importantly, how did your Monday go?</p>
<p>The consensus from me and Marissa was that this Monday was
unexpectedly wonderful.  I didn't have any meetings all morning.
Rodney was entranced by his own toys and activities.  As I worked,
Marissa sat beside me and caught up on some art business upstairs.
Miles sat behind us, happily rattling around in his bouncer.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you don't mind us being up here with you?" asked Marissa
looking up from her work.</p>
<p>"Never," I said.  "I love company regardless, but especially now
because I'm just doing one of those things where I have to hit a
button every five minutes and watch the output."</p>
<p>Almost on cue, the script running on my screen prompted me to press
<em>y</em>.  I raised my arm over my head and dramatically planted my finger
on the <em>y</em> key.  The script rolled on.</p>
<p>"See, now I have to do that again in five minutes.  Hard work, right?"</p>
<p>A perfect, quiet morning.  A morning that had no business here with us
in this cold, miserable month.  But a blessing nonetheless.</p>
<p>Yesterday Marissa picked up groceries and took another stab at Chicken
Tikka Masala.  Only a week later from her previous disaster, mistakes
were corrected.  The sauce had no flecks of burnt spices floating
around, but it was smooth and flavorful.  The rice was well-seasoned
and pillowy.  Both the neat stack of yellow tinted dishes in the
kitchen and the steaming plate of comfort food was a testament to a
disaster redeemed and a job well done.  Good job, Marissa.</p>

<p>While Marissa slaved over dinner, Rodney and I were tasked with
assembling our new exercise bike.  We were starting to wonder if it
had been lost in the mail, but Marissa happened to catch site of it
sitting on the porch of another house.  We're used to needing to swap
mail with the house down the street from us - the one with the same
house numbers as us, only rearranged.  It happens so often, I joke
that the city still owes me a paycheck for working part time as a
mailman.</p>
<p>I leaned in to check the label.  I hoisted the box over my shoulder.
I casually walked away, feeling a little tingle of adrenaline as if I
was stealing something from somebody's house.  I heaved the box into
the living room and Marissa checked the label.</p>
<p>"This isn't ours," she said.  My heart sank.</p>
<p>Marissa cracked a smile.  "Kidding," she added.</p>
<p>Rodney closed in on the large box in the middle of the living room.
He already had his tools out.  Together we took each of the pieces out
and began to assemble the bike.  Rodney, on a total hot streak lately,
nearly assembled the seat all on his own.  He managed to get a bolt,
washer, and nut fastened before I informed him the seat was installed
backwards.  Without missing a beat, he undid his work and corrected.</p>
<p>We fastened the heavy black pedals with rubber straps.  We screwed the
handlebars to the top of the frame.  We popped a fresh pair of AA
batteries into the back of the sensor panel.  With my blessing, Rodney
climbed on top and kicked for the pedals.</p>
<p>"I can't reach them," he said.  His legs dangled freely.</p>
<p>"Just scoot down," I said.  Rodney slipped off the seat and found the
pedals.  He pumped his legs.  He gripped the handlebars and the
machine took his pulse.</p>
<p>"It says your pulse is a <em>hunnnerd</em>, dude," I said.  "Nice."</p>
<p>"MAMMA!" Rodney yelled through the house.  "MY HEARD IS... ONE
HUNDRED."</p>
<p>Marissa chuckled from around the corner.  "That's cool, dude," she
replied.</p>
<p>After Rodney went to bed, Marissa and I each did 30 minutes on the new
bike.  Sturdy, smooth, and a lot harder than it looks.  After 30
minutes my shirt was soaked with sweat, but after being cooped up from
the cold all weekend it felt undeniably good.</p>
<p>A stationary bike is a game changer.  No special clothes or gear.  You
can keep an eye on Miles.  Not to mention it's a nice excuse to enjoy
some TV or YouTube videos in the evening.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by today.  Go have a Tuesday.</p>
