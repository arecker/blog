<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Hey everybody.  Happy Tuesday.  We're approaching the final day of my
spring break, and the work scaries are starting to set in.  I'm not
quite ready to go back, and that feeling of dread compounded when I
caught sight of how many slack messages and emails I have waiting for
me.  Dread.  Malaise.  Ennui.</p>
<p>I guess I can't put all the blame on work.  I'm having a hard time
getting back into the swing of things.  Chores, watching kids, cooking
meals.  Every time I try to summon the will to wake up early, clean
something, and do something constructive, the vacation mindset pulls
me right back.  Even though I've been home for a full two days,
mentally I'm still what you might call the <em>Primanti Brothers</em> state
of mind.</p>

<p><em>Sip</em>.  In other news, Minnie is still adjusting well.  She had us
wondering for a full day whether or not she would ever have an
accident in the house, but the little booger finally sprung a leak in
the middle of our living room.  Does this make her <em>not</em> perfect?  Far
from it.  It turns out that when girl puppies have accidents on the
floor, it's not the least bit a problem.  Their potty just smells like
dribbled some rose water or oil from a lavender scented diffuser on
the floor.  The point is, Minnie still carries an unblemished record
as a new child puppy in our home - absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>She does chew shoes though.  That's a new one for us, and it will no
doubt shake the delicate ecosystem of our house.  Our family is - (how
do I put this lightly?) - terrible at putting away our shoes.  We're
shoe idiots - we don't know how to manage our shoes.  I'm not just
finger-wagging either.  I'm just as guilty as Marissa and Rodney of
not putting our shoes away in the shoe cubbies when we're done with
them.  I started all the trouble when I made a special exception for
my black Adidas flip-flops.  Then we were leaving out our boots and
shoes.  Fast forward to present day, and now when Rodney enters the
house he flings his shoes in the middle of the kitchen, and I don't
always catch him right away.  But a shoe eater?  This changes
everything.  Hopefully Minnie can teach us a lesson that we couldn't
learn on our own, paying the price with gnawed shoe laces and
slippers.</p>

<p>We had a good day today.  We slept in, and after spending the morning
drinking coffee and lounging around, we got everyone ready for a quick
trip to the lake.  Marissa is sending some footage for an ink company
to use in a big art conference, and they needed some pensive
establishing shots of her walking around some place scenic.  The lake
side setting a few blocks from our house was perfect, and the swirling
grey clouds and churning wind looked very dramatic.</p>
<p>Rodney and I waited for Marissa outside in the driveway.  Rodney was
sporting his new sunglasses he brought back from Mimi and Poppa's
house.  They looked like Spider-Man themed Ray Ban's.  I took it as a
personal challenge to try to get Rodney to refer to them as his <em>Ray
Beezies</em>.</p>
<p>"Hey Rod, those are some really sweet <em>Ray Beezies</em> you're wearing," I
said, prompting some organic conversation.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I think they're pretty cool this time," replied Rodney.</p>
<p>"Man I wish I had some <em>Ray Beezie's</em> like that," I continued.  "Hey
dude, would you mind if I took a picture of you in your <em>Ray
Beezie's</em>?"</p>
<p>Mission accomplished.  After sneaking <em>Ray Beezies</em> into the
conversation at least three times, Rodney could be heard later in the
evening looking for his <em>Ray Beezies</em>.  "Hey dad, have you seen my
<em>Ray Beezies</em> anywhere?  I think I left my <em>Ray Beezies</em> downstairs.
I'd like to keep my <em>Ray Beezies</em> in my room."</p>

<p>We took a short drive to the lake.  We shielded Miles from the wind by
wrapping a blanket around his car seat.  I left him just a few feet
away in the grass while I taped Marissa walking thoughtfully along the
water.  It always feels funny taking Miles on trips like that.</p>
<p>After we got home, I got to work on dinner.  In the food world, it
feels like whenever I learn about something new I start seeing it
everywhere in unrelated places.  Last night while catching up on
YouTube I saw an instructional video for Ukrainian dumplings.</p>
<p>"Those look kind of like pierogi," I remarked.  Similar size, filling,
and texture.  I googled the term in the video.  "They ARE pierogi," I
exclaimed.</p>
<p>The stars were aligning for me to try pierogi.  I followed the steps
in the video, only I fried them in butter at the very end.  They were
decent.  My dumpling dough could have been a little thinner, but what
really stole the show were the grilled paprika onions.  Meow.</p>

<p>Oh, I realize I missed chump of the week yesterday.  If I had
remembered to do chump of the week, I would have handed the honor to
Four Seasons diner just outside the Ohio turnpike.  Four Seasons, from
the outside you looked like a charming, diamond in the rough purveyor
of American comfort food.  We looked to you for french toast and
waffles like desert wanderers to an oasis. But little did we know you
were just a grade school cafeteria in disguise.  Thanks for flopping
my strawberry sauced french toast into the to-go bag like it was a new
pair of tennis shoes.  Thanks for making sure Marissa's Belgian waffle
was as room temperature as it could possibly be.  Thanks for accepting
a tip, but letting me slink away without forks, knives, napkins, or
maple syrup.  That's right, folks - for her birthday dinner, Marissa
ate just a bare ass waffle.</p>
<p>Four Seasons, you're a bunch of chumps!</p>
