Dear Journal,

Good evening, everybody.  Happy Sunday.  Heading into the final few
hours of the weekend, the literal smell of soup lingers in the air
over the figurative stench of defeat.  Can we talk about that Bears
game?  If you were a fly on the wall of our house this afternoon you'd
hear things like "I wish we could play the Lions every week" and "it's
not so bad if we make the playoffs".  I wish I could turn back the
clock to around that time when everything felt like it was going to be
OK, before the strip sack, the answering touch down, and one of the
most befuddling and blundering offensive drives I've ever seen.  If
you were still a fly on my wall around 3 PM today, you'd hear some
different phrases that I'd rather not repeat here.

Rodney, while saying goodnight to me, summed it up best.  "The Bears
didn't win the trophy.  We'll have to try again."  Thankfully, there
was more to this weekend than disappointing football.  Marissa and I
thoroughly stress-cleaned our house during the fourth quarter.  I
caught up on chores and ordered groceries for the week.  I soaked our
coffee carafe in cleaning solution, and the gross little flecks of
dried coffee gunk washing down the sink make me think that tomorrow's
brew is going to taste really good.

_Sip_.  Are you among the angry Bears fans clamoring for a swift wave
of firings?  How do you pass the time during a stressful football
game.  And more importantly, how was your Sunday?

Today was picture day - again.  Yesterday was our family's surprise
top secret Christmas card photo shoot.  This morning, we rolled out of
bed and hurried out of the house to take our nice family photos by the
lake on Marissa's running path.  We jokingly referred to this set as
the "we put on real clothes" photos.  Baby Miles even wore tiny baby
shoes and a very scholarly wooly sweater for the occasion.

Have family pictures always been so impossible?  When Miles was
looking forward, the dogs were looking away.  When the dogs were
looking forward, Rodney was looking at Miles.  And when by some
miracle, the dogs, Rodney, and Miles were all looking in the right
direction, I was holding the camera crooked.  One shot we took was
perfect, except for Rodney's dog poop caked sneaker in plain view.  I
made silly baby sounds from behind the camera to get Miles attention.
Trying to help, Rodney made the noises to, and Miles looked back at
Rodney.  Meanwhile, our lovable Ziggy was growling and staring down
every cyclist whizzing by on the bike path.

I can also imagine how silly family photo day must seem to a kid.  Why
did we put on nice outfits just to sit on a little blanket in the
grass?  Why do you keep yelling at me, but asking me to smile?

Picture day was exhausting.  We were so zapped from the simple act of
taking photos out side that we had completely forgot to feed our old
Thanksgiving bread to the ducks, as we had promised Rodney.

Rodney was tired too.  He was so tired that he actually fell asleep in
his room during quiet time.  After getting our soup on the stove, I
peeked my head through his cracked door to find a very weird
situation.  His light was off.  His sparkly Christmas tree sat at the
floor by his bed, switched on.  His blue blanket was loosely draped
over a tiny figure lying across the bed.  I tiptoed closer.

"Hey buddy," I said, reaching out a hand to shake the blanket.  I
pulled the blanket aside, revealing long brown and yellow legs and
hooves.  I had been hoodwinked by a stuffed giraffe.

I scanned Rodney's room.  His closet light was on, and his window
curtains were draped over a mysterious silhouette barely visible in
the faint early evening light.  I approached the curtain and gently
moved it aside, finding Rodney sitting in his blue chair in front of
the window.  His head was slumped back.  His eyes were shut and his
mouth was wide open.

I chuckled.  Rodney stirred awake, and he shot up to his feet.

"Oh, hi Dada" he whispered.  "Baby giraffe is sleeping.  We have to be
quiet."  And with that, Rodney and I crept out of his room, shutting
the door behind us so his stuffed giraffe could sleep undisturbed.

For dinner tonight, we had pea soup with some pan fried croutons.  I
called it "grinch soup" to pique Rodney's curiosity.  As soon as we
started to dig in, I divulged the big secret behind our dinner.

"So this meal has two different things we ate on Thanksgiving," I
laughed.

Marissa looked at me in horror.  "How long ago was that?" she asked
nervously.

"This is the stock I made from our turkey, and the croutons are the
bread left over from making the stuffing."

"The bread we were supposed to give to the ducks?" asked Marissa.

"Yeah," I laughed.  "I'm kind of glad we forgot, I like it better as
croutons anyway."

Thanks for stopping by today.  Have a great rest of the weekend
everybody.
