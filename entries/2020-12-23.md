Dear Journal,

Good morning, everyone.  Happy Wednesday.  It's the eve of Christmas
eve - also known as Festivus.  And I'm not even pulling your leg
there - you can look it up.  The actual day Festivus is observed is on
December 23rd, the eve of Christmas Eve.  Time to dig the metal
Festivus pole out of the basement and set it up in the least
distracting corner of the house to honor the made for TV holiday.

_Sip_.  How are you feeling today?  Did you get to open any new
presents yet?  We were fortunate enough to dip into some of the
Christmas stash last night as part of the Recker family zoom-mas.  I
scored a dartboard, a game of Battleship, a new pair of Adidas
flip-flops to replace the pair that I've been wearing all winter -
with little time to spare too, these things were falling apart on my
feet.

I hate to be a bummer, but yesterday was so-so.  Looking at my
calendar, you'd think I'd have the most incredible day.  There wasn't
a meeting in sight.  I hacked on the same problem at my own pace until
quitting time, when I got to finish the work day with an hour long
nap.  I woke up to the smell of hot delivery pizza on the table.
Marissa and I opened up a bottle of wine and joined our family over
zoom to open presents and hang out.  But everything left me feeling
depressed, and this morning I'm still trying to figure out why.

I think I let my guard down and forgot to temper my expectations.
I've been so excited about this Christmas week and all the time to
relax with family that I didn't stop to consider the possibility that
Christmas over zoom would just feel like any other zoom hang out - the
same kind of zoom hang outs we've regularly conducted throughout this
entire pandemic.  We met.  We connected.  We opened gifts and shared a
few memories.  Then all at once, I shut my laptop lid and I was back
to putting the house back together in silence.

I'm feeling depressed.  The lessons never stop.  For today's lesson,
I'm trying to process the truth that it's normal to feel depressed
sometimes.  Christmas over zoom sucks, and if not for the tree in the
decorations in the house and the Christmas music we play in the living
room during the day, this would just be a regular slice of quarantine
life.  We're still waking up with nowhere to go.  Still the same
endless battle trying to keep things from going bad in my fridge,
wiping up crums, and spraying Windex on things.

I'm having a tough one today.  Some weeks in quarantine I feel
invincible, like I could do this another year if I had to.  And other
weeks, like this one, I feel utterly suffocated, and all I want to do
is spend the day eating fast food and screaming into a pillow.

Not to say that our time together as a family wasn't special.  Rodney
was in bliss looking at all the new toys he has to play with.  My dad
wrote a poem for each of us, and we read them aloud with equal parts
of tears and laughter.

After we had finished the call, Rodney begged us to help him set up
his giant remote control monster truck.  Marissa popped a pair of
batteries into the tiny remote control.  The truck's headlights glowed
a sinister red and the car stirred to life.

Rodney hurriedly put on his coat and boots.  With his mouth frozen in
a permanent grin, he piloted the truck out through the front door,
rambling down our cement steps after it.  Rodney proceeded to do
donuts in the front yard.  Together, we stood outside watching Rodney
peel up and down the side walk and into the street.

"WOAH WOAH WOAH," I yelled, watching the truck barrel towards the
adjacent busy street.  "Don't turn out onto East Wash, dude."  I made
my self chuckle picturing the bleak scenario of his shiny new monster
truck getting t-boned in traffic.  Rodney flipped the car around,
sending it careening back towards our house.  After we all had our
fill of monster truck fun in the snow, Rodney obediently brought his
new car inside.  "Night night, monster truck - thank you," he said
quietly.

Marissa put Rodney to bed, and as we straightened out the dining room,
we talked.

"Do you feel tired?" asked Marissa.

"Yeah a little bit," I laughed.

"Isn't it funny?  We didn't even go anywhere?" she added.

"There's a lot to learn from that, huh?" I asked.  "That just goes to
show how much thinking about something can tire you out."

I guess that's one aspect of quarantine that never fails to amuse me.
I still feel exhausted after a gathering, even if we didn't leave our
dining room.  There's a sense of relief when the webcam goes blank and
the microphone stops picking up audio that's reminiscent of coming
home from a long road trip or an evening filled with real socializing.

There's another lesson from quarantine.  You don't have to go anywhere
to feel exhausted.  Your brain is just as good at zapping your energy
as your body is.  Take breaks from thinking about something is just as
important as taking a break from doing something.

Before turning in for the night, I set up my new dart board on the
kitchen counter.  I handed Marissa a handful of darts.  We took turns
throwing at the target from across the kitchen.  The dogs, patiently
waiting to head upstairs for the night, nervously watched as flying
projectiles passed overhead.

"OK, closest to the bullseye wins," I said.  "And we can't go to bed
until you win."

"Oh gosh," said Marissa.  "I guess we're never going to bed."

Thanks for stopping by today.  Hope you have a wonderful day,
everyone - hang in there.
