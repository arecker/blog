<p>Hey Reader!</p>

<p>Hope you're staying cool out there in Chicagoland.  They said the temperature is supposed to reach a hundred today.  It's days like these that make you grateful for the modern marvels of air conditioning.  I wonder what an early farmer or a frontiersman would think if he saw me drinking a hot cup of coffee in an artificially cooled office.</p>

<p>I knew the heat was coming, so yesterday after lunch I went for a long walk.  Most days I do a single lap around my block, but when I'm really ahead in my work I like to walk a little further north of my neighborhood to Lancer Creek where a paved walkway follows a run-off creek, crowded by trees and dense prairie grass.</p>

<p>I sat at this bench for a few minutes - not because I was tired, but because I was gaining on the woman in front of me, who also went for a walk.  I sat down on the bench to swiftly disarm that awkward moment where you either have to pass a stranger or slow down and act like you are pre-ocuppied with something.</p>

<p>It was so muggy that the shade from the trees felt no different from direct sunlight.  Cicadas screamed over my head.</p>

<p>I've been trying to take more time to notice the plants around me.  I found what looked like tiny grapes on a vine that wrapped around the tree.  The leaves looked like they were disintegrating, leaving behind a delicate web of dry brown fiber.</p>

<p>The Lancer Creek path leads all the way to a high bridge that looks over a big concrete runoff well bordered by rocks.  Like all the other parks around here, the whole scene is smothered by thorny, weedy native prairie plants.  I stood there at the highest point of the bridge for another minute, taking in the exciting conclusion to my long, hot walk through Lancer Creek.</p>

<p>The path exits onto a quaint neighborhood street, where the next turn takes me to a busy road.  Feeling the full brunt of the summer sun radiating off the nearby asphalt, beads of sweat fell down my back as I trudged by the funeral home, the taco bell, the burger king, and finally the Jewel Osco strip mall just before our street.</p>

<p>I finished out the workday, and since we're still rich with leftovers, I didn't have to worry about fitting in a grocery store trip or cooking.  So I took a nap in the basement.  I woke up to the sound of Miles and Rodney's feet thumping through the kitchen.</p>

<p>I don't know why, but I suddenly had the silly urge to make monster noises.  Still buried under a thick blanket on the basement couch, I took a deep breath and growled.  The thumping feet above me stopped in their tracks.  I growled again, this time, putting adding a little more snarl to the sound.  I crept a little closer up the stairs to the closed door so they could really hear it.</p>

<p>I kept this game up for at least twenty minutes.  When I finally came upstairs, I found that Miles and Rodney had retreated into the safety of a blanket fort they built in the bedroom hallway.</p>

<p>Rodney adamantly rejected the possibility that the sound they heard came from a real monster, and he never wavered.  "I know when you're lying," he protested.  "You make that suspicious voice when you're lying."  His stubbornness just invited more teasing.</p>

<p>The basement monster gave us plenty to talk about during dinner.  Between slices of pizza, we debated whether or not we heard a lochness monster, or a bigfoot, or slenderman, or even <em>choo choo charles</em>.</p>

<p>Have a great day today.  Stay cool, and watch out for monsters.</p>
