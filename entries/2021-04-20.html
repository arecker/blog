<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Happy Tuesday.  How are you feeling today?  Did you go to bed early
last night?  Maybe you had a healthy vegetable snack out of the fridge
with a big glass of water on the way up the stairs?  That's OK,
neither did I.  Being my first night off of ticket duty, I went a
little crazy with the off-call celebration.  Marissa and I had just
finished a pretty boring movie and, wanting to end the night on a good
note, we gave ourselves a late night extension.  I buttered some of
that roasted garlic sourdough.  We snacked on dry cereal and goldfish.
It was a good time, and I knew the price.  I'm slowly warming up for
the day thanks to a shower and coffee.</p>
<p>This week at work is conference week.  My company is throwing an
internal tech conference.  All the sessions are over Zoom of course,
but it still feels kind of like a special week.  Instead of meetings,
my calendar is chock-full of conference talks, and the prospect of
just sitting and listening quietly while pushing the coffee sounds
pretty lovely right now.  Heck, I bet I could even watch some of the
sessions all throughout the house while doing dishes or folding
laundry or something.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em>.  Yesterday was Monday, right?  How did that all work out for
you?  I had a perfect Monday - the kind where there's only one measly
little meeting on the calendar.  I had the entire day to sort out my
own work and plan the next phase of the intern project, punctuated by
lots of mental breaks walking around the house.  Most of these "mental
breaks" were just taking Minnie outside to go potty.  Marissa and I
forgot how frequent the potty breaks are with puppies.  If she's not
sleeping or in her crate, she needs to be in the backyard every twenty
minutes.  Still, that's a small price to pay for enjoying a puppy.
The puppy phase is so brief, even now I feel like Minnie is a little
bigger in size every time I look at her.</p>
<p>It was Marissa's turn to cook dinner last night.  Arranging sliced
fruit and other ingredients around the kitchen, it was pretty clear
she was jazzed about the breakfast burrito recipe she had found.  And
while the sweet smells of breakfast-for-dinner leaked out of the
kitchen, Rodney and I got to hang out on the couch.  Together we went
down the YouTube rabbit hole of "feeding" videos.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, "feeding videos" are a very popular genre on
YouTube, and they're exactly what they sound like - just videos of
people feeding their exotic pets with live food.  They range in
animals, as they also range in quality - anywhere between a high
production nature documentary to a 13 year old kid in a dark room with
a GoPro.</p>
<p>There were many feeding videos to choose from, but we finally found
the diamond in the rough that is the <em>Exotics Lair</em> YouTube channel.
It's just one guy filming himself doing regular things for his vast
collection of spiders, like adding water to their dishes, cleaning the
enclosures, and tong feeding them worms.  But something about the way
he's caught off guard by sudden moves and how he chastises his spiders
makes it hilarious.  Rodney and I were practically rolling around on
the living room floor with laughter.</p>

<p>Marissa watched a sample in horror.  As we had just <em>barely</em> won her
over to our side of getting a tarantula, it was a risky video to play,
so I clarified.</p>
<p>"He said a lot of these are the <em>old world</em> tarantulas.  The ones that
are really aggressive," I said trying to quell her uneasiness.</p>
<p>Marissa shivered nervously and cringed.  "Why does he have to keep
them in such shallow containers?" she asked.</p>
<p>That's a good question.  Who knows why this guy is keeping very
aggressive spiders in two inch deep tupperware?  Maybe he knows that
the jump scare makes for better content.</p>
<p>Marissa served dinner.  As we set the table, she called me into the
kitchen to watch her flip the last burrito.  After searing one side of
the tortilla, the whole mass of hot cheese, egg, bacon, and vegetables
needs to be quickly flipped in the pan.  After four burritos she had
already mastered the deft motion.  Needless to say it tasted
incredible.</p>

<p>We watched a Hawks game.  In our first of three games against the
Predators, our boys got obliterated.  The loss stung extra severely
because the coach swapped out Marissa's favorite goalie, Kevin
Lankinen, well before the game ended.</p>
<p>"I think my jersey is cursed," commiserated Marissa, looking dejected
in her crisp jersey that read <em>LANKINEN</em> across the back.</p>
<p>"There might be something to that," I laughed.  "I'm pretty sure that
Akiem Hicks got injured the first game I wore my <em>HICKS</em> jersey."</p>
<p>I caught up on chores while the dogs napped in the living room.  I
placed Minnie in the cozy spot in our living room armchair.  Ziggy was
visibly annoyed.</p>

<p>Realizing I had created some strife between the two, I wanted to
reconcile them and encourage some sister snuggles.  I plunked Ziggy in
the chair beside Minnie.  I'll tell the story of what happened after
in photos that I took over the course of an hour.</p>

<p>It turns out that chair <em>is</em> big enough for the both of them.  Thanks
for stopping by today.  Have a great Tuesday everyone.</p>
