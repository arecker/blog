<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good evening, everybody!  Welcome to another rare weeknight evening
journal entry.  After slamming a chimmichanga for dinner, putting
Rodney to bed, watching a Hawks game, and putting in some time on the
stationary bike, writing is the last thing I feel like doing right
now.  But nevertheless, I owe you people a thousand words, and
dad-gummit I'm going to get it done.  Life is busy.  These days,
fitting something into my schedule is a game of inches, and the
haircut appointment which overlapped with my writing time by a measly
fifteen minutes was enough to bump it to some other time of the day.
From then, it was nonstop action all the way to the bitter end.</p>
<p>At least I finally got a haircut.  I went to the same salon that
Marissa frequents.  At 9 AM, I slammed a cup of coffee in the car and
took my place as the first customer of the day.  Marissa's stylist met
me at the door and showed me over to her station.  It was one of those
salons where a scalp and shoulder massage is included.</p>
<p>"Isn't that the best?" asked Marissa.  "The scalp massage is my
favorite part.  I always fall asleep."</p>
<p>I wasn't feeling it.  I'm most alert in the mornings right before I
start working, and as a result I wasn't really feeling the massage.
All the coffee coursing through my veins made it impossible to relax.
So I just stared straight ahead like a statue.  I even thought about
asking her to just skip it in hopes I could get a discount on the
bill.  <em>Excuse me, how much money do I save if we, like, don't rub my
head right now?</em></p>
<p>"So what are we looking for?" asked the stylist.  When I was younger
that question used to make me choke from nervousness.  Older and wiser
now, I came prepared.</p>
<p>"So I'm growing it out," I explained.  "But I don't like how moppy it
is.  Everything looks the same length, I literally feel like an upside
down mop head."</p>
<p>She pulled at the hair strands with her fingers, observing the weight
and length.</p>
<p>"I think I want to do an Owen Wilson look," I continued.</p>
<p>"Do you have your phone on you?" she asked.  I took my phone out of my
pocket.  We sat in silence while I flipped through head shots of Owen
Wilson.</p>
<p>I finally broke the silence.  "So, do you want me to keep it open,
or..."</p>
<p>"Oh sorry," she replied.  "I was just enjoying looking at Owen
Wilson."</p>
<p>I nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"You know you do kind of look like him," she said thinking aloud.  "I
can definitely do that with your hair.  I can't help you with the
nose, though."</p>
<p>"After COVID I'll make it a point to get in a bar fight," I quipped.</p>
<p>We chatted as she got to work combing and snipping.  She noticed a
crease where I usually part my hair.</p>
<p>"So you're, like, thirty?" she said.  "I can tell because you part
your hair to the side."</p>
<p>"Wow, spot on," I said.  "Tell me more, I'm amused."</p>
<p>"Millenials part their hair to the side.  Have you heard about this
thing where Gen Z teases them for not parting it down the middle?"</p>
<p>She explained that side parts just make receding hair lines look even
worse - and my hair was receding.  That was probably the first
<em>getting old</em> pill I've ever had to swallow since turning thirty.</p>
<p>"So don't part it to the side," she advised.  "You're going to want
to, but you'll have to train your hair."</p>
<p>I was determined to apply her wisdom.  When your doctor tells you how
to exercise or what to eat, you listen.  Why shouldn't you also listen
to a stylist when they tell you how you should be wearing your hair?</p>
<p>That being said, I massively underestimated how difficult it would to
not part my air.  Several times while working today, I instinctively
reached at my hairline to sweep everything to the side, and I had to
stop myself.  It's not an understatement to say I thought about where
my bangs were sitting all day.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em>.  In other news, the other day Rodney saw a Ryan's World video
featuring a dunk tank.  Ryan's family constructed a cage where his dad
would sit, and they threw balls at a target until it knocked Ryan's
dad in the water.  Since finding that video, Rodney has become
positively obsessed with dunk tanks.  He's fascinated with the
concept.  He recreates his own dunk tanks with Lego's, K'nex, and
pillows on the couch.  Several times while passing him to refill on
coffee, Rodney has invited me over to try his blanket and pillow
version.  Rodney had me sit on top the back of the couch.  He threw a
dog toy at a pillow propped up against the fireplace.  Taking my cue,
I slid down the back of the couch into the imaginary water.</p>
<p>"Now dadda, you have to say <em>Oh!  It's wet!" directed Rodney.  No dunk
tank transaction is complete without gratuitous humiliation.  _Oh no,
I'm soaked!  There are... um... blankets everywhere</em>."</p>

<p>Not even Green Dino, his tenured childhood toy, was spared from dunk tank humiliation.</p>

<p>Rodney has rediscovered the K'nex we stashed away in his room after we
decommissioned the family roller coaster.  He's mainly concentrated on
dunk tanks right now, but somewhere in the wreckage I discovered a one
armed man wearing skates and holding a hockey stick.</p>

<p>It was a long day today.  Having to go without my morning writing
ritual, I felt a little off balance.  I hate the weekday mornings
where I don't have time to write.  Even though I won't have much to
say tomorrow morning, I'm still looking forward to the return to form.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by tonight.  See you tomorrow morning, readers.
Have a wonderful night.</p>
