Dear Journal,

Good morning, everyone.  Happy Monday.  Hope you have something warm
to wear and some hot coffee to sip on.

It's no secret that I'm the kind of person to lean into the winter.
If I had a favorite season, that would be it.  Here we are in October,
and all it took was a small dusting of frost for me to let my Winter
enthusiasm run hog wild.  Yesterday for dinner we celebrated the first
frost with some beef and vegetable stew, a spicy bottle of malbec, and
of course, curling on the couch to watch the movie _Frozen_.

Going to make a painfully uncontroversial understatement here, but
_Frozen_ is a pretty good movie, isn't it?  Each year we watch it, it
seems to climb the ranks of my personal favorite Disney movies - not
that that's a very big list anyway.  _Frozen_ has earned my respect.
The opening score gives me chills.  I find the imagery and the
characters compelling.  There's lots of little hidden jokes sprinkled
around for the parents.  I'm as shocked as anyone that I've become so
loyal to a Disney movie.  Maybe I just had to endure enough terrible
kids media before that could ever become a possibility.  Helplessly
sitting through the endless repeated punishment of _Trolls_, _Bolt_,
and - _shudder_ - Blippi - might make you count your blessings and
appreciate that narrow sliver of good movies you can watch with your
kids.

"I'm so glad that they never made a sequel to this movie," said
Marissa during the opening credits.

"Yeah, isn't that great?" I replied.  "How cool that they just left it
alone, it makes the movie even better."

We're well aware they made a _Frozen 2_.  But Marissa and I have
entered into a sacred pact where we don't mention it and just pretend
it never happened.  In fact, I'm pretty sure that's the last time I'll
ever mention it in this daily publication.

Rodney is also excited for winter.  Putting him to bed, he started to
ramble about all the fun winter activities he planned for the morning.
"I'm going to make SNOW ANGELS," he said crawling into his blanket
with wide eyes.  Needless to say, the small dusting last night wasn't
quite enough to make that possible.  Rodney will have to be a little
more patient.

"I'm depressed about winter," said Marissa clutching her hoodie,
staring out into the backyard.  "We've been talking about it like it
was far off, but now that I can see snow, it's just so..."

"Permanent?" I said finishing her phrase.

Marissa nodded.  "Yeah.  I guess it feels a little permanent."

"We'll have fun with it," I said.  "It might suck, but I'm prepared to
gut through it and make it as fun as possible."

_Sip_.  How's your Monday going?  How are you feeling today?  Did you
wake up in bed with your head and legs switched around?  Around our
house, we call that _pulling a Miles_.  Lately, each time we get him
out of his crib, he's turned around the opposite way.  I'm sure it
gradually happens throughout the night with incrementally small
wiggles and squirms, but I'd like to imagine that he's instead figured
out how to spin quickly on his butt, like a break dancing move.  Just
picture it.  A baby who secretly break dances when his parents aren't
watching.  I ought to pitch that to Disney - _that_ could be a movie.

I'm feeling good today.  The stars are aligning for a great start to
the week.  My on-call shift ended an hour ago.  We have good food and
wine in the house.  And of course, the Bears play today.  Sitting here
in my Bears jersey drinking coffee out of my jumbo sized Bears mug,
I'm wondering if I'm laying on the enthusiasm a little thick.  In
fact, if the Packers didn't have a nice little blowout over the Texans
yesterday, I might have had to leave my laptop camera off today.  I
don't want to be accused of rubbing in the fact that the Bears are the
top playoff seed in the NFC right now.

A weekend without football felt strange.  With all the exciting games
happening yesterday, I felt a little left out.  But I'll take a Monday
night game too - especially one during my first night off duty.
Here's to shutting off my obnoxious phone and leaving it in the corner
so I can nervously sit perched on the edge of my couch.

In other news, make sure you remember to take your vitamins today.
For us, that means four, soon to be five supplements - not counting
the Flintstone vitamins.  Marissa and I got in a small quarrel over
what I see as a growing problem.

"Is it OK if I get some Calcium too?" said Marissa.  I slammed my beer
on the counter and bit my lip.

"Calcium?" I repeated.  "We gotta take Calcium too?  Who says?"

"I remember a nutrition prof I had say that Calcium was good, and I
don't drink a lot of dairy."

"Well can you just start drinking milk?" I asked.

"I don't like the texture," said Marissa.

"What about our water, there isn't enough calcium in it?" I retorted.

"I don't drink our water, I like bottled," said Marissa.  "You don't
have to take it if you don't want to."

"Yeah, but it's still another vitamin we have to add to our routine -
I still gotta help arrange them all on the cutting board before we go
to bed.  And they take up space on the window sill."  I said.  "I just
think it's getting out of hand."

"Do you have something against vitamins?" said Marissa.

"I just..." I began to stumble over my words.  "I don't want to commit
to taking like nine vitamins forever.  It's a little tedious.  Like,
how many vitamins is enough"

"Twenty six," said Marissa with a smirk.  "The whole alphabet.  What,
are you picturing some kind of apothecary spilling over into the
kitchen.

"Sort of, yes," I laughed nervously.  A thought popped into my head.
"What about multi vitamins," I said, snapping my fingers.  "Can we
just switch to multis?  You know - consolidate."

"I think those Flintstone gummies are technically multivitamins," said
Marissa.  She picked up the colorful can to inspect the label.  "Oh,
so it's got C and D.  You know if you want, we can probably stop
taking those if we're just good about the gummmies."

"That helps," I sighed.  "Sounds like a small thing, but that clears a
little more room on the shelf."

Thanks for stopping by today.  Have a great morning, everyone.
