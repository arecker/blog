Dear Journal,

An old lady visits a busy shopping mall to buy her grandson a birthday
present.  After circling the parking lot for an hour, she finally
finds a spot and walks inside.  She buys her grandson a new pair of
shoes, then stays to eat dinner in the food court.  After finishing
her meal, she wanders out into the parking lot to find her car.  She
walks up and down the still crowded lot to no avail.

The woman flags down a mall security guard.  "I can't find my car,"
she says to him.

"No problem, mam," replies the security guard.  "I'd be happy to drive
you around the parking lot until we find it."  So she jumps into the
security squad car, and together they begin to wind through the long
rows of cars.

An hour passes, and the woman still hasn't identified her car.  "I
tell you what, mam," says the security guard.  "The mall will be
closing soon.  People will leave and it should be easier to find your
car."

"That's a long time to wait," says the woman.  "Do you think we could
get some icecream?"

The security guard agrees.  He buys her an icecream cone from the food
court, and together they wait another half hour.  The street lights
come on.  Slowly, people trickle out of the mall, get into their cars,
and leave.  The security guard takes one more pass with her around the
entire parking lot, but still no luck.

"I'm a little thirsty," says the woman.  "Do you think you could buy
me a coke?"  The security guard buys her a coke at the food court and
they continue to wait.

"OK," he sighs.  "The mall closes in a half hour.  Everyone will have
to leave, so your car should be even easier to identify."

They wait.  With five minutes before the mall closes, only two cars
remain.  There's a lime green minivan with a canoe strapped to the
roof, and on the other side of the parking lot there is a beige sedan.
Sitting in the squad car, the two watch the final mall visitor make
their way across the parking lot, climb into the beige sedan, and
leave.

"Oh right!" says the woman.  "My car had a canoe on top.  Must have
forgot."

That was the first "anti-joke" I heard.  You know, jokes where the
punchline is so stupid that you can't help but laugh.  We're only,
what, week number two into joke Fridays and I'm already resorting to
anti-jokes?  I realized that when you exclude dirty jokes we used to
tell each other in little league baseball and political jokes that are
so old that they don't make sense anymore, I don't have a lot of
material to draw from.  Maybe it's high time to pick up a joke book,
or at the very least buy a bag of Laffy Taffy's.

_Sip_.  Happy Friday, readers.  Thanks for joining me on this chilly,
drizzly day.  The weather can do whatever it would like today, for all
the sunshine I need is radiating out of my heart knowing that the
weekend is nigh.  Nothing left to do but a team restrospective, a
risky software rollout to our staging environment, and maybe some
loose ends in slack here or there.  A _long_ weekend, at that.  We
have good 'ol MLK to thank for that.

So how are the New Year's resolutions coming along?  I guess by now
you've learned whether or not you really want to stick with them.  I'm
still on track with mine - not to say I haven't shaved some of them
down to be simpler.

I'm still dieting, but I can't count calories anymore.  It's just too
tedious.  Entering every meal and snack into my phone was a lot more
feasible when I ate things with barcodes.  Bachelor Alex had no
problem scanning a breakfast bar in the morning, a package of ramen
for lunch, and a frozen pizza for dinner.  But how are you supposed to
add pork with mushroom and cream sauce?  Pan-fried honey garlic
shrimp?  A sfincione?  At a certain point, tracking all these calories
started to take longer than it did to actually eat them.  In that way,
counting calories feels anti-cooking.

So I stopped logging breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I stopped logging
workouts to.  All that was left was the snacks.  It became clear to me
that with my body it really just comes down to the snacks.  The things
I take to the couch at night.  The things I munch on while I'm
cleaning out the fridge.  The things I shovel in my mouth on the way
to bed.  And so my new radical weight loss program was born - the
_stop snacking so much_ method.  No more taking handfuls of goldfish
crackers on the way up the stairs.  No more oatmeal cookies out of the
freezer when I make trips to the kitchen.  No more breaking into
tomorrow's leftovers while I wait for the dogs to come back in the
house.

It's a difficult habit to break.  Between my constant need to chew on
things, my strong compulsion to eat food before it gets thrown away,
and my love of pairing exciting with evening drinks, I feel like I was
hard wired to snack.  I'll always be a snacker, but I can learn to
keep it under control.  Friday and Saturday are for snacking.  During
the week, I'm as straight as an arrow.

Speaking of food, last night was crunchwrap supreme night.  Ground
beef, refried beans, shredded sharp cheddar, tomatoes, sour cream, and
cabbage all packed around a crunchy tostada and wrapped soft white
tortilla to form a little polygon of goodness.  We've had so many
"warm plate" meals this week, it was a nice change of pace to just
toss a couple of tinfoil disks on the table and go to town.  While I
made extras for lunch, Marissa hung out in the kitchen with me to
enjoy a podcast about the Bears.  The hosts were really fired up about
the disastrous press conference held by the team's leadership.  Their
message could be boiled down to "this season wasn't good enough, but
we're not changing anything."

"Just wait," I said.  "They're going to play the voicemails next."

Hoge and Jahns encourage fans to leave voicemails with them during or
after games and big announcements.  Fans are also encouraged to use
the thickest Chicago accent they have at their disposal."

"It's kind of therapeutic," laughed Marissa.  "Like - I'm mad, but it
feels good that other people are mad too."

Of my favorite zingers was "The Chicago Bears are a generational
heartbreak machine."  As always it was followed up with a quick "_bear
down_" before the phone hung up.

Thanks for stopping by today.  Have a wonderful weekend everyone.
