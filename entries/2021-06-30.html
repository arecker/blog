<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everybody.  Happy Wednesday.  Thank you for visiting my
bug blog, I have numerous bug updates and close-up pictures of bugs to
share.</p>
<p>After yesterday, I was planning on laying off the bug content for a
while.  But this morning I happened to catch another beetle emerging
from a pupa.  Time of birth: 8:12 AM.  Our Eve was wriggling out of
her pupa like you might escape a sweaty sleeping bag.</p>

<p>She's an "honorary" she.  I don't know the actual sexes of these two
beetles.  I read online that if they are well fed, you can apply a bit
of pressure to their head and pop out their genitals on the other side
of their body for a clear inspection, but it's a little too early in
the morning for that kind of rough treatment.  Welcome to the nursery,
Eve (or Steve).</p>

<p>I had a feeling her pupa was on the way.  Last night, I took out one
of the cups for Rodney to look at.  Most of the pupas are tough and
sturdy, like little lego pieces.  But Eve's pupa wriggled.  Rodney and
I gasped.  The pupas look enough like little sci-fi aliens, but
watching one of them gently wriggle reached a whole new level of the
heeby jeebies.</p>
<p>That's it, done with the bug talk.  It's safe to resume reading and
drinking your coffee at the same time.  Speaking of which, how does
your coffee taste today?  How are you feeling?  Good, bad, happy, or
tired, it's already Wednesday and we're hot on the heels of a long
holiday weekend.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em>.  I haven't talked about Minnie in a while.  Minnie is still a
puppy in spirit, but she's growing into her awkward teenaged body.
Marissa and I compare her butt to a wiggly pencil eraser.  The hair
around her ears continue to grow out, making her look like a tiny mad
scientist.</p>
<p>She had her own little routine.  Just after all the dogs wolf down
their breakfast, Ollie and Ziggy retreat upstairs for more sleep, and
this drives Minnie crazy.  She follows them up the stairs, trying to
entice them into a morning romp by biting at Ziggy's neck and ears.
Minnie's tiny feet bound down the stairs moments later and she prowls
around the living room, hunting for something to amuse her.  From
around the corner, while I'm making coffee I usually hear her break
into Miles' play corner where she feels the freedom to behave like a
real toddler.  She digs around in the soft bins and cubbies for a toy
selection, then over the course of five minutes, gently destroys it.</p>
<p>"OK, Minnie.  It's dead.  Good job, now move on," I sighed, scooping
up a plastic toy plate riddled with teeth marks.  Minnie reluctantly
moved on to her favorite toy: the plushy drill with the hidden button
that says "DRILL! BZZZZZZZZ".</p>

<p>After Marissa, Miles, and Rodney awake, Ziggy joins Marissa on the
couch or curls around her feet while she works at the computer.
Interestingly, Minnie prefers to join me and Ollie upstairs for most
of the work day.  Minnie doesn't seem like the industrious type, but
we suspect that she's just vying to get on Ollie's good side.  She
sleeps in the back of his crate.  Ollie treats Minnie like his ditzy
summer intern.  If she sticks with it, in time she'll learn to
facilitate design discussions and proofread my code the way Ollie
does, but for now it's better for her to just sit quietly and watch
how the work gets done.</p>

<p>Ah, I just remembered that I promised to finish that story about my
dead neighbor Pam.  I don't mean to be so crass about her death, but
there's no need to be delicate because Pam is no longer dead.  Pam
lives in a leafy burnt orange house across the street from us.  She
happened to be mingling on her porch while Marissa was fending off a
pushy solicitor.  Marissa waved, and Pam drifted into our front yard
for a friendly chat.</p>
<p>"I was worried about you," said Marissa.  "I saw you get taken away in
an ambulance and then we didn't hear from you in a while, I'm glad
you're OK."</p>
<p>"I was dead," said Pam.  "The doctor gave me the wrong medicine and my
heart stopped.  I was dead in my house for eighteen minutes."</p>
<p>That was enough of a tag line to draw me into the story.  I left my
empty garbage can in the middle of the driveway so I could hear her
explanation.  Pam said that the doctors barely revived her, but she
was practically brain dead.  They told her husband she didn't have a
chance, but she credits her husband for convincing them to <em>try
anyway</em>.  They froze Pam in an induced coma.  She died in December and
woke up in mid February the following year.</p>
<p>"It was weird," said Pam.  "Cus, you know where they do all this stuff
is not a regular hospital room.  I woke up in this giant building,
like the size of your house, and there were guys wearing hazmat
suits."  Pam describes her first moment of consciousness like an alien
abduction.</p>
<p>"Did you see anything?" I asked.</p>
<p>Pam smirked.  "Oh, like while I was dead?"  Pam rocked nervously on
her heels.  "I promise I'm not weird," she said unprompted.  "I always
thought there was something after death, and now I know.  I talked to
old friends and met new people.  I remember talking to an Indian girl
in a tipi - I promise I'm not weird!" she laughed.</p>
<p>"Everything was great at first," she continued, "but then all of the
sudden everything got dark, and I saw a lot of horrible things.  I
think it was while they were un-thawing me."</p>
<p>Pam explained her theory about how things started to get a lot scarier
when the doctors were bringing her out of the coma.  They had to
slowly raise her body temperature, and somewhere in her subconscious
this led her to believe that she was burning in hell.</p>
<p>"I saw horrible things," she reiterated.  "My hands looked so burnt
and charred from fire that they looked like they belonged on a
gorilla.  I felt overwhelmed with sadness.  It was like I realized
that if I believe all the good things that happen after death, I
<em>have</em> to believe all the bad things too."</p>
<p>Her conclusion almost felt too profound for a mid morning chat in our
front yard.  "So that was my quarantine.  The doctors called it a
miracle," said Pam, breaking the stagnant silence.  "They said my
brain would never work again, but look at me now!"</p>
<p>We thanked Pam for the interesting story.  She politely waved, then
staggered back to her leafy burnt orange house.  As she walked away I
felt lucky to know someone who was embraced by death, frozen in a
coma, shuttled through heaven, hell, and back to the land of the
living just to resume daily life at the corner of Union street.
That's the story about my (formerly) dead neighbor Pam.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by today.  Have a great Wednesday, everyone.</p>
