Dear Journal,

Good evening, everyone.  Happy Saturday.  A dark day in the
Thanksgiving holiday weekend timeline, as I think today marks the day
we've officially gotten sick of leftovers.

They had a good run in our house.  The first two plates of stuffing,
turkey, and mashed potatoes, along with the break from cooking was a
nice feature of Thursday's mega meal.  But after putting all the
ingredients on a sandwich with swiss cheese, then later frying those
same sandwiches in more cheese like some kind of mutant Thanksgiving
lover's grilled cheese sandwich, our family has officially reached our
gluttony limit.  I even turned away a slice of Marissa's homemade
blueberry pie a few minutes ago, so you know it's the real deal.
Tonight for dinner, we got takeout from the Great Dane.  I'm normally
not a big fan of their food, but tonight it seemed appealing on the
grounds that it wasn't soaked in butter and turkey juices.

_Sip_.  How far have you gotten through your Thanksgiving leftovers?
Have you just been heating up plates of the full Thanksgiving meal, or
have you tried any soups, sandwiches, or maybe even a Thanksgiving
Lover's pizza?  And more importantly, how was your Saturday?

Today was an even lazier day than yesterday.  Sometime in the
afternoon after waking up from my nap, I summoned the will power to
get out of bed, put on some real clothes, and find something to do
with Rodney for fear that I would have nothing to write about.  Rodney
and I found the perfect task - decorating the "boys' tree".

The "boy's tree" was something Marissa and I invented this weekend.
While decorating the Christmas tree in our living room, she was
anguishing aloud about whether or not to let Rodney lend a hand.
Marissa's proud of the tree.  She puts a lot of love and care in how
lights and ornaments are arranged.

"I feel bad, because I know Rodney would love to help, but..." said Marissa.

"What if you set up another tree for him to decorate," I said.  "When
I was growing up, my mom had the nice tree on the main floor in the
window, and the kids tree was in the basement.  That's the one that
had all the goofy kids' ornaments."

"Could we set up a little one over here," said Marissa waving at the
corner of the playroom.

"Perfect," I nodded.

Rodney and I got to work decorating the boys' tree this afternoon.  We
didn't have any silly ornaments on hand, so we just had to make due
with the fancy Christmas tree rejects.  We had our pick of shimmering
ornaments missing their hooks, golden pine trees that were shedding
their glitter, and all the leftover sparkly pine cones that didn't fit
on the big tree.

Marissa had some leftover lights from decorating the outside of the
house.  She decided to put them up in Rodney's room as at treat.
After stringing the lights along the top edge of his ceiling and
carefully tucking the excess cord behind his door, we called Rodney
into his room for the big reveal.  Rodney was ecstatic, taking hold of
the little wireless remote like it was a precious relic.

We would later learn that due to a small electrical oversight, this
wireless remote was on the same channel that controlled our Christmas
tree.  As Rodney played with his lights during quiet time, our elegant
shimmering Christmas tree blinked wildly in the living room.

Getting Rodney out of his room from quiet time, I noticed that one of
the strands of lights in the corner of his room slumped a bit.  I
stood on his little blue chair to investigate.

"What happened here, dude?" I asked.

"I think it was a ghost," said Rodney, launching into his own
conspiracy theory.  "A ghost was in my room, and he didn't like the
Christmas lights.  So he made them fall."

Tonight before bedtime we watched the original Grinch movie.  Thanks
to all the relentlessly positive Nick Jr. programming in our house,
Rodney has come to think that all movies make him sad.  Not wanting
him to miss out on all the good Christmas movies we could be watching,
we set out to gently cure him of this assumption.  Tonight we watched
the original Grinch movie.  Rodney stared thoughtfully at the TV while
the Grinch crept around Who houses, stealing decorations off the wall
and presents from under the tree.

"This makes me kind of sad," said Rodney.

"It's OK dude," said Marissa.  "Movies have a sad part, and they have
a happy part.  Don't worry - the happy part was coming."

Rodney hung in there until the Grinch's heart grew three sizes bigger
and he rushed down the hill on his sleigh to deliver all the gifts
he'd stolen.  Rodney let out a satisfied sigh.

"Awww," he said.  "That's so nice."

Putting him to bed tonight, Marissa tells me that he was still reeling
from the movie.  "The little girl woke up!" recounted Rodney.  "And
she said _Hey green slizzard - why are you taking our presents away_."

"Green slizzard?" I said confused.

"He thought the Grinch was the green goblin, or the lizard from
Spider-Man," explained Marissa.  "He can barely keep them straight as
it is."

In between decorating the house, Marissa and I also started on
expanding the upstairs desk in our bedroom.  As Marissa began to cut,
sand, and rearrange, I predictably became very uneasy.

"You seem kind of irritated," said Marissa.  "You knew we were doing
this, right?"

"Yeah," I said, rubbing the back of my neck.  "And I thought I would
be cool about it.  It's just a little overwhelming, I'll get over it."

Do you have any physical spaces in your life that seem to directly
affect your sense of balance?  For me, my bedroom desk is one of those
places.  And as the new wider stained wood desk was drilled into
place, I felt the monkey fist in my back relax.  Suddenly I was in the
mood to make some changes to my familiar work area.

"What do you think about this?" I said, holding my monitor up
vertically.  "I've been thinking about going back to being one of
those vertical monitor people."

"I think it would look really cool," said Marissa, smiling.
