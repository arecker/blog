<p>Dear Journal,</p>
<p>Good morning, everyone!  Happy Tuesday, from my computer screen to yours.  How are you feeling today?</p>
<p>I'm running a bit behind this morning.  Weirdly, I overslept by only about twenty minutes today, so I'm waking up in the worst of both worlds.  Not only to I have the sensation that I'm trying to catch up with my day, but I also don't really notice the extra sleep, as it just amounted to a power nap.  Next time, I'll be sure to oversleep by a few hours just to make the mistake count.</p>
<p>But I'm here now, right where I'm supposed to be - writing at the keyboard, drinking a fresh cup of coffee.  The dogs have been fed and relieved, and Krang is downstairs in his jar chewing on a fresh 113 g scoop of wheat flour.  The morning routine prevails.</p>
<p><em>Sip</em>.  It feels good to be drinking Rockford's Fire Department Coffee again.  We took a little break from our usual brew to work through a big bag of Starbucks House blend that my parents treated us to.  And kind of like coming home from a long vacation, you simultaneously enjoy the variety as well as the return to the usual.</p>
<p>Would you like to hear some exciting fish tank news?  Yesterday, we woke up two what looked like <em>two</em> blood fire shrimp hanging out in the tank - one of them a fresh, vibrant Bruno, and the other a ghostly pale molt.</p>
<p>"I think Bruno molted," said Marissa.  "Ugh, I think I could puke."</p>
<p>"Oh cool," I said shuffling over to the tank in my bathrobe.  "You know I read on reddit that if you leave the molt in the tank, he'll eventually just eat it."</p>
<p>"We're not doing that," protested Marissa.</p>
<p>"Oh c'mon," I persisted.  "It's his first molt.  It's kind of... significant, right?  Bruno became a <em>man</em> last night."</p>
<p>"He has twenty-four hours," said Marissa narrowing her eyes at me.  "Then I throw it away!"</p>
<p>To be honest, Bruno shedding his exoskeleton was hardly the big fish news yesterday.  We also made the trip to the clown fish depot and picked up <em>Ibb</em> and <em>Obb</em>.  We named them after a silly little video game Marissa and I played when Rodney was first born.  Ibb and Obb are doing just fine.  After completing the acclimation out of their plastic bag, I think they appreciate all the new extra space with only one loner of a shrimp roommate to deal with.</p>
<p>And speaking of which - geez, Bruno.  You picked a terrible day to pull this gross exoskeleton stunt of yours.  Are you trying to freak out the clown fish?</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I finally got around to making a recording of myself reading the Dutch short story <em>De Noordenwind</em>.  For someone who was starting to think they were getting good at Dutch, hearing your own isolated audio is a helpful, albeit crushing reality to face.  Every imperfection seemed to leap into my headphones - the stuttering, the weak vocal chords, the <em>r</em>'s that don't quite bounce, and the dipthongs that don't quite hold their shape.  On one hand, I feel proud of how far I've come in a year, but I'm also grateful for the reality check.  Learning a new language takes some serious time, and if only a year of Duolingo was all it took be ready to chat up a none-the-wiser native speaker, wouldn't more people be doing this?</p>
<p>If you're curious to hear where I'm at, or you're just in the mood for a shoddy bedtime story, help yourself to <a href="/audio/noordenwind.mp3">my recording</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, for dinner, I made crab mac and cheese.  Marissa teased me that I seem to make seafood whenever we add a fish to our tank, and so far that holds true.</p>
<p>"I just bought imitation crab," I said before we started eating.  "I was excited about trying it with lobster, and I knew lobster was expensive, but I didn't know it was <em>that</em> expensive."</p>
<p>"How much was it?" Marissa laughed.</p>
<p>"They only had one giant lobster tail in the freezer at Hy-Vee, and it was $37 dollars," I replied.  Marissa practically did a spit take.</p>
<p>"Compare that to the imitation crab, which was a cool five bucks for this whole pack," I laughed.</p>
<p>And even for just being a type of mac and cheese, the recipe was kind of involved.  It started with a wasabi and butter roux, milk, fresh nutmeg, paprika, and finally a whole bunch of freshly grated white cheddar.  The fondue was tossed in a casserole dish with imitation crab meat seasoned with old bay, and finally topped with buttered parmesan bread crumbs before being smothered in heat under the broiler.</p>
<p>"What - you didn't like the crab?" I said sharply.  Marissa had a little mound of cheesy crab meat scooted to the side of her plate.</p>
<p>"No! I like it," said Marissa defending herself.  "I just ran out of noodles to go with it."  Rodney too had a little mound of imitation crab meat scooted to the side of his cleaned plate.</p>
<p>"Oh, you and your 'ratios'," I said with a wave.  "You two are a couple of weirdos if you won't eat imitation crab covered in cheese."</p>
<p>After putting Rodney to bed, Marissa and I cleaned up the house, then moved further along with this week's movie pick: <em>Avatar</em>.  And with two hundred words remaining in this post, I think I'll just spend them on taking shots at the movie <em>Avatar</em>.</p>
<p>First off, you would have to conclude that the money spent on perfecting the CGI in avatar was a waste.  Watching the movie on a new living room TV in 2020, the visuals were about as impressive as they are in <em>A Bug's Life</em>.</p>
<p>"Seriously," I heckled.  "This scene right here - with all of them running across the tree branches, could be right out of <em>A Bug's Life</em>.  And how big was the budget for that movie?"</p>
<p>Marissa laughed.  "You have a point.  Now I feel like I'm watching <em>A Bug's Life</em>."</p>
<p>And you should have heard us heckling in the scene where rugged American marine Jake Sully locks eyes with a dragon, wrestles it to the ground, and forcibly connects their love braids together.</p>
<p>"Nah, you're reading into that," protested Marissa.  "That's not creepy."</p>
<p>"Look," I explained.  "The line about how <em>you know a dragon chooses you when it tries to kill you</em>, especially in the context of soul bonding... it's a little too close to <em>no means no</em> territory."</p>
<p>And wouldn't you know it?  The very next scene was a love scene between Jake Sully and the native.  With an explicit call back to the dragon scene.  <em>She must also choose me</em>, said Jake Sully.</p>
<p>"I told you it was a metaphor," I said smugly.  "James Cameron should be glad he got this movie out before #MeToo, or he would have been in some hot water for the insinuations here."</p>
<p>That's what I got today.  Thanks for stopping by.</p>
