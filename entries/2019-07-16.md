title: anger and patience
---

Dear Journal,

Earlier in the summer I decided to do something about my anger. I would
never have described myself as an angry person, but for some reason,
every now and then, I would just explode over small things, and it
bothered me, and I wanted to find the source.

I read a tip online that said to keep an "anger journal". Every time you
lose your temper, write down where you were, what the trigger was, what
thoughts were going through your head, and the people affected. Here's
one of the milder entries.

``` {.example}
- Trigger :: Video games
- Location :: Living Room
- People :: Marissa, Ollie, Ziggy
- Thoughts :: These people didn't even try their own game.
- Events :: Was playing Skate 3, and I got frustrated at the
            repetitive laundry list of objectives I had to complete.
            Started ranting about how lazy the developers were and got
            too angry about it.  Ollie got scared.
```

The idea is after a while, you can observe a pattern to the outbursts,
and hopefully be able to anticipate them before heading into a situation
that usually triggers you. From May to June of this summer, I logged ten
outbursts, and they all in one way or another were triggered by
something that didn't work as advertised: software, a new recipe, a
video game, not being able to find something, etc. It only took a month
to observe a pattern: something I was working with would fail my
expectations, then I would blame something.

I learned from keeping an anger journal that I have problems with
patience. I don't like to wait around for things. I don't like when
things get in my way. And I definitely don't like when things don't work
the way they should. Video games should be enjoyable. Recipes should be
practical. Software should be reliable. The cycle of blame that would
usually follow was very toxic. It took me a while to learn the tough
lesson that losing your temper around people has consequences. In fact,
if not for the *who was affected by this* field, my anger journal would
be a light hearted comedy about a buffoon learning to cook and yelling
at a computer. But what you say to people matters, and they remember
when you blame them for things.

I've made it a few weeks without having to add anything to the anger
log. I can now anticipate frustrating situations, and I deal with them
by taking a step back and saying to myself "this may not work very well,
and that's OK".

A lack of patience, weirdly, has been kind of a motivator for me most of
my life. Because I don't like to wait around for things, I'm a fast
learner, I like to automate things, and I'm never satisfied with
multi-tasking. But it's clear to me that learning patience is important,
not just for the people around me, but because I'm missing out on a lot
of things in life because I'm not willing to wait for them.

Let's practice patience today.
