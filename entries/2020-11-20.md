Dear Journal,

Good morning, everyone.  I'm pleased to report that today is in fact
Friday, and in only a short work day from now you are officially
relieved of duty.  Welcome to the weekend.  I'm looking forward to
this weekend.  I'm not on call.  We're going to be doing some
Thanksgiving prep grocery shopping.  We're hanging Christmas lights
around the yard.

Marissa and Rodney already got a jump on things yesterday.  They hung
sparkly white lights all around the backyard perimeter, taking
advantage of the beautiful day.  Apparently yesterday was in the
sixties.  Clicking through our google photos, I see that even baby
Miles got to hang outside in the backyard in his saucer, taking in the
beautiful weather.  Being the busy dummy that I am, I didn't even make
time to step outside yesterday.

Even though we've already begun to hang Christmas lights, don't worry.
We're not going to break protocol.  Nothing is getting switched on
until after Thanksgiving.  I have however extended a personal grace
period for Christmas music.  I started listening to Chance the
Rapper's Christmas mixtape over a week ago while I clean the kitchen,
just to prime the holiday pump.

_Sip_.  How was your Thursday?  Mine was socially stimulating.  I was
in an out of zoom calls with people all day.  In the morning I hung
out with Branden, teaming up to grade a take home assignment submitted
by a prospective intern.  We'd pick it back up again in the afternoon
just before my final meeting of the day to check in with our intern
Connor.

"So I read something scary," began Connor.  "What is this 'intern
review' we're doing?"

"Intern review?" I asked.  "I don't know anything about that."  Connor
smirked, and I sensed my genuine ignorance was just coming off as
cagey.  His eyes darted to another place on his screen, reading a
slack message aloud.  "_Want to pick up on this intern review?_"

"OH that," I laughed.  "Those are code screens for future interns.
You already went through all that, you're done."  We got to talking
about code reviews, and what exactly makes code good.

"If I'm being honest," I explained.  "The most important thing to me
is that the code does what it's supposed to do.  Most of the time I'm
reviewing code, I'm just testing it.  Afterwards I assess the way it
looks, but that doesn't usually lead to any big discoveries."

"It just sounds like you've been beaten down," laughed Connor.
"Doesn't there have to be some kind of standard?  What if the code is
just a mess?"

"I hear you," I said.  "I pay more attention to how they got there.
If they were running their code often and being very disciplined about
changing one thing at a time, I like that."

"But this is a take home assignment," reminded Connor.  "Remember,
they consider this _finished_."

That was a good point, and it got me thinking about how my paradigm
for code review may need to adapt to grading a take home test.  I
can't rely on _how they got there_ if I can only see the end product.

Connor went on to tell me some stories of what it's like being a
computer science TA at the university.  How it feels when he's handed
a mess of code and just asked to 'fix it', or what a struggle it is to
pull valuable lessons out of arcane sample code that has been buried
in the curriculum for years.

"You've seen a lot of ugly code," I laughed.  Perhaps there's
something there that explains our different perspectives on code
quality.  I wonder if just a week of grading undergrad Computer
Science assignments would be enough to change my staunch _function
over form_ philosophy.

Signing off for the day, I found my way into the dining room.  Marissa
was on the computer shopping around for eat out places to try.  We
settled on sushi from a cajun-japanese place near campus.  Cajun and
Japanese fusion might sound odd to some, but it's actually not the
first time we've come across such a combination.  I'm pretty sure I've
already raved about our favorite cajun stir fry place in the mall.

There was a knock.  I retrieved the tied plastic bag from our porch
through our cracked front door just as the delivery driver slipped
back into her car.  I set out the food at the table.  Marissa and I
divided up the sushi rolls, and on Rodney's plate we arrange some
chicken tenders and a small pile of fries.

"Tonight is a little different," said Marissa.  "No timer, it's just
eat out night and we're trying something new."

"How about this," I interrupted.  "You have to eat just one sushi
roll."  I reached across the table, gingerly setting a single piece of
caterpillar roll at the end of Rodney's plate.  Rodney obediently
picked up the roll, nibbling off the side.  Rodney finished the roll
with the help of a few more gentle reminders.

"I told Rodney he was a good boy for finishing his sushi," said
Marissa after he went to bed.  "He asked me to make sure that Santa
hears about it."

I laughed.  "Of course," I replied.  "He got lucky.  I already talked
to Santa, and it turns out that single piece of sushi was the deciding
factor for Christmas gifts this year.  The mighty pups tower was on
the line, and he made the big play when he had to."

As we talked about Christmas presents, Marissa grabbed a magazine off
the kitchen table.  It was a Bed Bath and Beyond brochure.  "Speaking
of which," said Marissa tossing the magazine onto my lap.  "Circle the
things you want, and put stars by things you _really_ want."

I smiled.  "I know the drill," I said, thinking we were on the same
page.  But apparently I took it a little too seriously.  After packing
up the house for the night, I brought the magazine upstairs with me.
I crawled into bed with it and began to page through it.  After only
five minutes, I reached the end of the magazine, finding nothing to
circle.

"So I was really disappointed, I didn't find anything I actually
want," I said as Marissa entered the bedroom.  Seeing me with the
magazine, she laughed.

"Oh no, I'm so sorry," she said.  "I was joking.  I didn't think you
would actually do it.  Their magazines are usually just the dumb
stuff."

"Yeah," I whined.  "This is all just blankets, candles, bath
salts... I even brought a sharpie in bed with me.  All I circled was
this carving knife, and to be honest I think I was just reaching."
