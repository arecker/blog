Dear Journal,

Good morning, everyone!  Happy Saturday.  The weather was so nice
today that the real world of work, stress, and the pandemic felt so
far away.  What a relaxing Saturday.  I hope you're taking it easy
this weekend, using the time to catch up on sleep, getting some fresh
air, and eating some good food.

For better or for worse, I decided to reinstall the OS on my laptop.
I was getting a little board running Debian and decided to spend my
Friday night trying to get something else to work.  I went with the
elusive and obscure [Void Linux], which I'm sure means absolutely
nothing to 99.99% of you reading this.  This flavor of computer is a
little new to me, so my writing tools aren't fully configured.  For
instance, I don't have my custom spellcheck working yet.  But I was
able to restore my trademark screensaver with the floating, rotating
3D molecules at least.

_Sip_.  What a wonderful Saturday.  Rest.  Good food.  Nerdy computer
fun.  This morning I emerged bright and early to get a jump on
cleaning the kitchen, and I took another swipe at my work-in-progress
sourdough lemon scone recipe too.  Following the notes I took from the
last trial, I used slightly more sugar, slightly less salt, and a
whole lot more milk.  The flavor greatly improved.  The consistency
was pretty much the same, only it was easier to work with.  I'm
thinking that by the next trial, it will be ready to join the other
recipes in the family cookbook.

Rodney was first to join me.  He came bounding down the stairs in his
pajamas, scooting up to the dinner table with wide eyes.  He started
helping himself to the plate of bacon before I even had his apple
juice poured.

I had a fun programming stream later that morning.  I decided to take
a break from the pico8 gaming and work on a different side project.
Earlier this weekend on a long car ride to the fish store, Marissa and
Rodney got to talking about Minecraft.  I demoed the game for Rodney
that evening.  With Rodney getting better at computer games, I think
we have the makings of a new temporary family obsession.  Marissa
hinted that I should set up a new minecraft server for us all to play
on sometime this week, and I decided to knock it out in the my live
stream slot.  I got the server working, I rigged it up to start on
boot, and I even threw together a nice little script to back up the
game files once every hour.  It was a great time.

We ate some leftover pizza for lunch.  With plenty of time to kill
before quite time, Marissa suggested I take Rodney outside to break
down some of the cardboard we had been hoarding in the shed all
winter.  I'm not sure why, but the idea disgusted me at first.

"I don't want to turn this into a work day," I said.  Even I was
puzzled by those words as they left my own mouth.  It was Saturday.
It was warm.  I had spent the morning playing with code on the
computer.  Of course it was a work day.  "Nevermind," I huffed.
"We'll get it done."

Rodney and I threw on some work clothes and headed outside.  Even if
it was only in the 40s today, the air felt warm, humid, and
refreshing.  Rodney stood ready to help as I flung open the garage
door.  Cardboard mountain loomed before us.

It was a good day to finally clean up this mess.  During the colder
months, cardboard tends to accumulate in our garage, but ordering
supplies and toys online all throughout the long quarantine made this
year remarkably bad.  The layers of cardboard mountain told a story.
Toward the bottom, the boxes were collapsed and flattened.  But
climbing higher up the mound, you can almost see where we started to
give up on keeping it tidy.  I recognized many of the boxes from
running out into the cold and snow late at night in my flip-flops.
I'd open the garage door just a crack and stuff the box inside without
even looking at where it ended up.

Rodney and I made quick work of cardboard mountain.  I hacked and
sorted the boxes with a pocket knife.  Rodney wandered off into the
shed to rediscover his bike, his hockey stick, and all his other old,
forgotten toys that had been sealed away in the shed all winter.

Meanwhile, Marissa took on the daunting winter dog poop clean-up.
It's wise to clean up all the winter's dog poop on the first warm day
of the year.  If left to fully thaw, that stuff can quickly turn your
yard into a poop flavored swamp.  She filled an entire black garbage
bag.

Rodney and I celebrated finishing our chores with a snowball fight.
It was fun trying to beam him in the head with an iceball as he fled
into our front yard.  It didn't hurt him of course.  He was wearing
his bright red spider-man bike helmet, and it made for an excellent
target.

We planned on taking a family walk.  I was inside pouring some coffee
for the road.  Miles waited patiently on the deck in his clip-in
stroller car seat.  Suddenly, we heard crying.

Rodney's fingers were wet from snow.  Miles' face was red and just a
bit swollen.  Rodney had thrown a snowball at his brother.  I scolded
him, commanding him to sit in a kitchen chair while we tended to his
brother.  Rodney crumpled into a ball of tears.  The fiasco made us
take a rain check on our walk, and we instead sent Rodney to his room
to contemplate his sins.

Rodney is a gentle kid.  There's no way in hell he intended to hurt
his brother.  He just acts on boyish impulses before he has a chance
to think them through.  I called Rodney down the stairs with my
booming scary voice.  He approached me and Marissa in the living room.
His lips were quivering.

"I have an idea," he said with tears.  "I could just use a tiny snowball..."

"NO," I yelled.  "Rodney, you can't throw snowballs at your brother.
He's just a baby, he could have been hurt."

Rodney wailed.  His face ran with tears.  He fell to his knees with
contrition.  We exchanged hugs and Rodney wiped his tears.  After just
a bit more time in his room to cool off, he joined us on the couch.
Rodney, eager to redeem himself for pelting his baby brother, fetched
me and Marissa a pair of beers from the basement mini fridge.

"You want something to drink too?" I asked.

"Chocolate milk," said Rodney with a zero second delay.

That's what I got today.  Don't throw snowballs at babies, and have a
great weekend.
