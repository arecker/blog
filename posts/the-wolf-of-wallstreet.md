Hello brave readership.  I'm back after a long Christmas break to talk about stocks.  Bears.  Bulls.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica?  I don't know anything about stocks, but my wife and I just finished the movie *The Wolf of Wall Street* two nights ago and I had some thoughts.

In this movie, Leo plays the greedy, self-driven, pill-popping, yaht-tipping, booze-drinking (participle-using?) wall street stock broker Jordan Belfort.  He's a real guy too.  The movie is based on his memoir sharing the name of the film. Belfort started a company that sells *pump and dump* stocks - really terrible investments that are artificially hyped so they will sell quickly.  After the company defrauded millions of dollars from their clients over about seven years, Belfort's company was taken down by the FBI.  All in all, it's a massively entertaining movie.  The film moves quickly, feels worldly, and features the most blissful Matthew McConaughey scene I have ever witnessed.  The only thing I want for Christmas this year is to learn that *this* scene was improvised.  (NSFW)

The movie is not exactly for the *morally* faint of heart.  The film made it clear that Jordan Belfort was really into some stuff that would probably make Caligula blush.  Don't watch it with your mom.

When the movie had ended, I was curious about the character.  Was he still alive?  Is he still in jail?  Did his heart explode from all the drugs he's done in his life?  As always, I went to Wikipedia.  I found out that Jordan Belfort only served *twenty-two months* in prison.  He was also ordered to pay back 110.4 million dollars to victims as restitution.

To date, Jordan has only paid back 11.6 million dollars.  Mind you, this is after book deals, a movie deal, and a successful motivational speaking circuit.  Meanwhile, Belfort shamelessly markets himself as *the REAL Wolf of Wall Street*.  According to Wikipedia, Belfort told an audience in Dubai

> "I’ll make more this year than I ever made in my best year as a broker."

What blew my mind was that Jordan Belfort, a career scammer and real life anti-hero, is still making money.  The disappointing ending to the movie sort of seamlessly continues into the disappointing reality that this guy is still rich out of his mind off of the movie you just watched.  I'll have one serving of *irony*, Mr. Scorsese.  Hold the *justice*.
