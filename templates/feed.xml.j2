    <content><![CDATA[
               Hey Reader!

               I love these lazy stretches of time before the holidays.  My time feels like my own.  Each day is ours for the taking, whether we want to do something adventurous or just languish on the couch and watch Christmas movies.

               In between school days, long naps, and fast dinners, we&#x27;ve searched around town for the best Christmas lights.  The most obvious place to start was Schaumburg&#x27;s drive-through light show.

               &quot;It&#x27;s forty bucks,&quot; sighed Marissa.  &quot;Everything is such a racket in Illinois.&quot;

               [figure light-show]

               In their defense, the light show was nothing short of spectacular.  String lights, arches, and plastic trees glowed together in sync with the upbeat music hissing from our radio.  Cartoonish polar bears, reindeer, and Christmas lights mouthed along to the lyrics.  We made the final turn into the grand finale light tunnel.  Feeling playful, Marissa opened our car&#x27;s sunroof and climbed on top for a better view.

               [figure better-view]

               Hearing about our quest to find the most impressive Christmas lights, our neighbor Pam tipped us off to a house just a few blocks up the road.  &quot;It&#x27;s like a full blown light show,&quot; she chuckled.  &quot;Cars pull over on their curb just to stare.&quot;

               Pam wasn&#x27;t kidding.  We easily found the house she was talking about.  Lots of houses on the street sported blinking lights, moving projections, and big inflatable snowmen.  But this house was serious.

               &quot;TUNE TO 88.9&quot; read the message on a scrolling marquee just before the show began.

               [video danger-zone]

               We&#x27;ve visited the house two more times since.  We pull over on the curb, turn off the lights, and enjoy a light show that honestly rivals the official Schaumburg one... for forty dollars cheaper to boot.  It doesn&#x27;t just play top gun either.  There was an animated sequence for Mariah Carey&#x27;s All I Want for Christmas.  The screen projected over the front door played snippets from Christmas Vacation.  We don&#x27;t know the owner of the house, but based on the synced up radio broadcast and animated singing characters, we surmised it was probably the same person that does the Schaumburg light show.

               [figure wine-tasting]

               Marissa and I scored a baby sitter and attended a Blackhawks game.  We arrived early to participate in the free wine tasting held in the United Center lobby.  We shuffled through the serpentine line a few steps at a time.

               &quot;Look at that,&quot; I whispered to her.  &quot;They&#x27;re only serving like two people at a time.  They&#x27;re probably asking all the same questions too.&quot;

               By weird coincidence, the couple in front of us turned around and initiated an idea.  &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s just sample these together so you don&#x27;t have to wait.&quot;

               The guy from the visiting winery greeted us with the same long-winded pageantry that held up the line so much, but pretending to be friends with two complete strangers made it more fun.  As he handed me a small glass of malbec, I leaned in and asked &quot;Excuse me - where&#x27;s the spit bucket?&quot;  The guy just frowned.  For trying this tired joke for the third time of the night, Marissa gave me a disapproving head shake.

               [figure computer]

               &quot;I&#x27;m deploying my drone,&quot; said Rodney, staring into a hand-drawn computer screen on a glued piece of paper.  Rodney makes computers.  He draws his own widgets, graphs, and figures on the screen.  His keyboard includes every letter of the alphabet.  There&#x27;s even a little raised indent on the space bar, just like the computer he uses at home.

               &quot;Where are you sending your drone?&quot; I asked over the dull roar of the tavern.

               &quot;To see Santa,&quot; he said.  He spun the paper laptop in my direction.  &quot;Here - ask Santa what you want.&quot;

               I leaned into the paper laptop.  &quot;Hi Santa.  Can I have a new knife set?&quot;

               Rodney got me a knife set for Christmas.  Marissa didn&#x27;t realize that my paypal was linked to our family room computer, and when she placed the order I promptly got an email.  Since it was Rodney&#x27;s idea, I agreed to play it cool, but in the meantime why not drop some hints to make Rodney feel like he did a good job?

               I severely underestimated his intelligence.  On the way home from the restaurant, Rodney piped up from the back seat.  &quot;Dada.  Why did you say knife set?&quot;

               &quot;What... what do you mean?&quot; I replied.

               &quot;You asked Santa for a knife set,&quot; he stated.  &quot;That&#x27;s... suspicious.  Did you... peak at something?&quot;

               &quot;No, I...&quot; my voice cracked.  I couldn&#x27;t believe my six year old son had me on the ropes.  &quot;No, it just popped into my head.  I... you&#x27;ve helped me in the kitchen before, you&#x27;ve seen how bad my knives are.  I could definitely use some new ones.&quot;

               Rodney didn&#x27;t say anything else.  He just left me to dig a deeper grave for myself.

               &quot;I think you&#x27;re being suspicious,&quot; I said more assertively.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Hey Reader!

               Flu season shows no mercy.  Miles, Rodney, Marissa, and I are all afflicted.  We take turns on the couch.  We look to sports drinks, crackers, and soup for comfort from the nagging headaches, barking coughs, and fatigue.  It&#x27;s a good thing that I took the rest of the year off for my sabbatical from work, because the truth is I probably would have just called in sick for most of this week.

               Isn&#x27;t it funny how your body can stave off getting sick until you&#x27;re done with your work?  Our symptoms fell swiftly after we packed up the One of a Kind Art show.  It was a great week.  We set up shop in the Merchandise Mart.  While Marissa put the finishing touches on her display, Miles and I wandered around and helped ourselves to the vibrant downtown scenery.

               [figure views]

               Whenever we put on art shows in Chicago, I think about this quote from Anthony Bourdain.

               &lt;blockquote&gt;
               &lt;p&gt;You wake up in Chicago, pull back the curtain and you KNOW where you are. You could be nowhere else. You are in a big, brash, muscular, broad shouldered motherfuckin’ city. A metropolis, completely non-neurotic, ever-moving, big hearted but cold blooded machine with millions of moving parts - a beast that will, if disrespected or not taken seriously, roll over you without remorse.&lt;/p&gt;
               &lt;/blockquote&gt;

               Our rental van got towed.  It was my fault.  It was a complicated and expensive monkey wrench thrown into our plans.  As I stood there among the bustling, throbbing heart of downtown Chicago in the empty space our van was once parked earlier that day, I thought about this quote.  Chicago is beautiful and exciting, but my God it can really just roll over you sometimes.

               [figure booth]

               We had a great show.  Marissa sold a lot of paintings.  We met lots of good people.  We ate some delicious food.  In my brain I can still taste the pork belly and duck liver mouse sandwich I finished off Marissa&#x27;s plate - truly something special.

               [figure sandwich]

               On her busiest day, I foolishly returned from a lunch errand with Indian food.  There was little chance we&#x27;d be able to partake without making an unsightly mess in her pristine art booth, so we ate our lunch in shifts.  I sequestered myself to a quiet table in the back of the artist lounge on the opposite side of the floor.  As soon as I cracked the plastic lid, pungent garlic and curry smell saturated the little room.  Armed with only a single cocktail napkin to catch the dripping butter, I did my best to ignore the angry darting eyes from the few vendors that were using the quiet room to catch up on work and make phone calls.  &quot;I&#x27;m the breakroom terrorist,&quot; I typed in my phone to Marissa while my shoulders heaved trying to contain my laugh.

               Did you have a nice Thanksgiving?  We sure did.  I have to confess that I&#x27;ve stared at this photo in my camera roll a few times this week.

               [figure thanksgiving]

               Be well, reader.  Rest up and keep pushing those fluids.  With any luck, we&#x27;ll be back in fighting shape before Christmas.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Hey Reader!

               Hope you&#x27;re all staying warm out there and finding the energy for one last push through work to the holidays.  We had a lot of things to do around the house in preparation of having Poppa Wilke over for the weekend.  In truth, all that preparation probably wasn&#x27;t necessary.  Poppa Wilke is a wonderfully easy house guest.

               &lt;h3&gt;A Chilly Day at the Zoo&lt;/h3&gt;

               We took Poppa Wilke to the zoo this weekend.  When it&#x27;s cold outside, going to the zoo actually isn&#x27;t a bad choice.  We wore layers.  We stuffed our pockets full of hand warmers.

               [figure zoo]

               Most of the animals cuddled and napped in caves or on beds of straw.  This polar bear had the right idea.  &quot;I would totally snuggle with that Bear,&quot; I joked.  &quot;We could curl up on the couch and just watch football all afternoon.&quot;

               [figure polar-bear]

               Walking around the zoo on a cold November afternoon, you can find warmth in humid monkey caves or the pungent stink of the indoor pachyderm hut.

               [figure walking]

               &lt;h3&gt;German Pancakes&lt;/h3&gt;

               &quot;I&#x27;ll take the German pancake,&quot; said Marissa confidently.

               &quot;That&#x27;s gonna be about twenty-five minutes,&quot; said the waitress.

               The warning gave Marissa pause, and she picked up the menu off the table to scan over the options again.

               &quot;Just do it,&quot; I whispered.

               &quot;Yeah, ok,&quot; she said quietly back to the waitress.  &quot;That&#x27;s fine.&quot;

               A short twenty-five minutes later, we&#x27;d witness how serious this place was about the German pancake.  The waitress used two hands to lower it to the table like a flying saucer landing in a farm field.  It easily eclipsed our lesser breakfast dishes.

               [figure pancake-1]

               &quot;Is that... gonna be enough food for you?&quot; I asked.

               [figure pancake-2]

               &lt;h3&gt;Farmboy&lt;/h3&gt;

               I wandered out of my office and into the dining room.  The view I caught from our window puzzled me - why was Rodney pushing hay bales up the driveway?  Marissa was packing up our Halloween decorations for the season.  Marissa was knelt in the dirt, picking up the chewed scraps of pumpkins left from the squirrels.  &quot;He looks like a little Dutch farm boy,&quot; she laughed.

               &quot;Now boy you move that hay for your mother,&quot; I called out.  &quot;Then I believe the cows need a milkin&#x27;.&quot;

               [figure farmboy]

               &lt;h3&gt;Swinging&lt;/h3&gt;

               Miles and I went to the park.  He ran right toward the swing, dashing my hopes of a nice break on the bench scrolling my twitter feed.  Miles wanted to stay on the swing the whole time.  We made up a game within a game playing catch with his baby dinosaur.

               Hey Reader!

               Over the next few weeks, I&#x27;m going to be making some changes to my website - a new theme, a new cadence, and a different feel.  You can expect shorter, punchier snippets from my life with a less formal tone.  I&#x27;m also going to retire my trusty &quot;Dear Journal&quot; opener.  It served me well while getting my writing habit off the ground, but it&#x27;s time to begin a new chapter.

               I may take some breaks from writing while I work out the new site design, but in the meantime, you know where to find me.  Enjoy.

               &lt;h3&gt;The Dino Show&lt;/h3&gt;

               We politely sidestepped through a restless crowd in a cramped section of the Allstate arena.  We were there to see the live Jurassic park show - the very same one that was featured on one of Rodney&#x27;s favorite YouTube channels.  Rodney&#x27;s not (yet) a famous YouTube influencer, so we had to settle for the nosebleed tickets, but we made up for it by buying him this &amp;dollar;35 light up shock stick.

               Think of a number between 10-20.  That&#x27;s probably a good estimate as to how many times Marissa and I have felt the cruel jab from that stupid shock stick.

               [figure stick]

               Question for the group - at a dinosaur show for children, am I allowed to drink a beer?  Even if I justified it, it wasn&#x27;t happening.  There were simply too many people in line at the single hectic concession stand.

               [figure parents]

               The whole production was actually pretty good - not that any of the kids really cared.  In fact, the most amusing part of the live dinosaur show was listening to the crowd murmur grow anytime the human actors had to get through a substantial amount of dialogue.

               &quot;Listen to them,&quot; I laughed over the restless roar.  &quot;They&#x27;re all bored.&quot;

               &lt;h3&gt;A Walk in the Sculpture Park&lt;/h3&gt;

               Having a lot more time to kill before dinner than we expected, we decided to take the boys to the sculpture park.  The boys seemed content to tag along anywhere, and as a small bonus, Marissa and I could burn off some calories before an indulgent dinner at our favorite Mexican place.

               Our neighbors John and Kathy mentioned the sculpture park to us a few times in passing.  It&#x27;s about a five minute drive from our house, but those who brave the journey up a construction torn Roselle Road are rewarded with a tranquil walking path through the woods lined interesting art installations.

               &quot;Is that John?&quot; said Marissa.  After I had finished parking the van, I turned my head and saw a burly man walking a big dog.  He recognized us and grinned.  We had a brief chat with our neighbors, then followed the path into the woods for our own journey.

               [figure sculpture-park]

               We found a giant metal buddha statue, a sleek curvy metal bench, and an arrangement of rocks that kind of felt like stone henge.  Don&#x27;t ask me why, but we had the urge to set all the stuffed dinosaurs we brought in the middle, like some kind of weird build-a-bear sacrifice.  It made for a good surreal photo.

               [figure dinos]

               The sun set quickly, and within five minutes of wandering along the path, we were enveloped in darkness.  Miles must have felt a little intimidated by the dark forest, because he clutched Marissa&#x27;s arm with two hands.

               &quot;I think... we should go to dinner,&quot; said Rodney, trying to sound braver than he was feeling.  &quot;Or we&#x27;re gonna get lost or something.&quot;

               &lt;h3&gt;The Pizza Boys&lt;/h3&gt;

               I didn&#x27;t feel like cooking last night.  Almost simultaneously, Marissa and I blurted out the same suggestion - &quot;pizza?&quot;.  It was a Lou Malnati&#x27;s night, and nothing was going to stop us.

               When we order food, I try to pick up the food myself.  I don&#x27;t have to tip a driver, and I can feel a little bit better as a parent on lazy, gloomy days knowing I took the boys somewhere other than their own living room.

               &quot;Where are my pizza boys?&quot; I parked.  &quot;C&#x27;mon, let&#x27;s go.&quot;

               The Lou Malnati&#x27;s trip is always quick.  Rodney begs me to take sharp turns.  Still adjusting to the wide girth and turn radius of our new minivan, I absolutely botch the parking.  The three of us waddle into the side carryout door.  The boys stand on the wooden bench and stare out the window while I get our order from the counter.

               &quot;The pizza boys,&quot; chimed Marissa after we returned.  &quot;I like that.  It sounds like they&#x27;re a podcast or something.&quot;

               &quot;We&#x27;re the pizza boys - just two regular guys and best friends talking about beer, pizza, and life,&quot; I bellowed.  &quot;Support us on patreon!&quot;

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, friends.  Welcome to Wednesday.  I&#x27;m here at the family computer in our dining room.  There&#x27;s a cozy morning chill in the air, and after a hot shower the draft feels kind of nice on my skin.  Miles is wide awake in his dimly lit bedroom, but we&#x27;re going to just ignore him for a few more minutes so we can get the old journal entry out.  Besides, he&#x27;s engaged in some kind of spirited debate with the stuffed animals arranged around his crib.  We had better not interrupt.

               Sip.  Rodney hopped off to school just a few minutes ago sporting his burgundy colored pants and yellow shirt in honor of &quot;fall colors day&quot;.  This outfit was only slightly more difficult than the one we threw together yesterday for pajama day.  Yesterday, Rodney literally wore the same pajamas he went to bed with, and to his own smug satisfaction, he just kept them on for bedtime yesterday too.

               [figure feta]

               Rodney and Pam are good friends.  He always makes a point to greet her when he&#x27;s waiting for his bus.  It probably helps that her name is easy for Rodney to remember - Pam Pidgeon.  He says it like it&#x27;s one word - &quot;Pampidgeon&quot;.  He also thinks pretzels are called &quot;prenzils&quot;, but I digress.

               We hiked to the other side of the cul-de-sac where are neighbors John and Kathy were sitting on the porch with their dogs.  From there, we set out on a longer journey up the street.  To cut down on the walking and conserve Miles&#x27; energy, we piled into the &quot;candy wagon&quot;.  Pulling the candy wagon all night was a good enough exercise, and it gave me a stronger case to help myself to their candy later that night.

               [figure candy]

               Miles fell down about twelve times.  But only one of those was a faceplant, so all in all it was a successful night.

               [figure trick-or-treating]

               It&#x27;s nice to be finished with Halloween.  The hectic last minute candy shopping, school events, and spontaneous junk food snacks were starting to wear us down.  Marissa picked up a bad head cold.  I was starting to feel it to, but I managed to stave it off with a solid power nap.  For us, we&#x27;ll use the next few weeks to quietly regroup - home cooking, keeping up with chores, and watching hockey on the couch at night.

               [figure halloween-napkin]

               Hope you have a good Wednesday.  See you around, Internet friends.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everybody.  Is it Monday already?

               Sip.  I was hacking on my website over the weekend, and I noticed that the header on my homepage still reads &quot;Daily, public journal by Alex Recker&quot;.  Judging by the last few weeks, this is turning into more of a &quot;Monday&quot; blog.

               Dear Monday.  Good morning, Monday.  How&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s Monday doing?

               I just changed the header.  I&#x27;m still not sure how often I want to write, but I don&#x27;t want to just be a Monday blog either.  I can blame the lapse on a number of things.  The WGN morning crew still has a strange psychological hold over my delicate morning brain.  At least once or twice last week, I sat down to write but instead longingly stared in the direction of the TV listening to the faint sound of the 9-at-9 music.

               Also, the kids are tiring us out.  They have their moments, but lately life with them has felt so exhausting that in the rare quiet moments around the house, I immediately go into self-care mode.

               This one, especially.  I see the appeal, but lately I&#x27;m not a fan of this one.

               &quot;He sleeps like a jerk&quot;, said Marissa quietly while she scooped all thirteen of his stuffed animals back into his bed.

               Either Miles is still sick from the last virus or he just dovetailed into a new one.  He hasn&#x27;t been sleeping well, which makes him grumpy in the mornings.  The grumpiness worsens throughout the day, especially when it&#x27;s time to sit down at the table and eat.

               Enough complaining.  Today is Halloween, and it&#x27;s time to celebrate.  Last week, Rodney&#x27;s school held a &quot;Trunk or Treat&quot; event.  Being our first ever Trunk or Treat, we wanted to get it right.  Marissa, hankering for a good paper mache project, got to work on a giant dinosaur head.

               Rodney and I returned to the Polish grocery store.  Still on a quest to find the most delicious Eastern European treat it has to offer, we rolled the dice on a hefty jar of pickles.  When we got to the front of the register, the cashier noticed it didn&#x27;t have a bar code.  She asked me how much it was.

               Well, she first asked me something in Polish.  But I heard the words &quot;no&quot; and &quot;barcode&quot;, so I made the connection.

               &quot;I dunno - five dollars?&quot; I shrugged.

               The cashier gave me a worried look.  &quot;No...&quot; she said.  &quot;Too much.&quot;

               &quot;How about four dollars?&quot; I asked.

               At this point, our checkout line began to fill up, and the other patrons waited they happily listened in on the pickle drama.  A husband and wife couple and an older lady all shook their heads in disappointment at my last suggestion of four dollars.  The older lady leaned in close.

               &quot;That is still too much.  It should be cheaper.&quot;

               What do I know?  This is a big jar of pickles.  It&#x27;s even still got the bayleaf and peppercorns floating around in the brine - gourmet stuff.  If this jar were sitting on a shelf at whole foods, four dollars would have been a bargain, if you ask me.

               Tonight, I&#x27;m taking these two wingisses around the block to pick up more candy.  More updates to follow.

               Have a great Monday, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everybody.  Welcome to Monday - it&#x27;s time for a journal entry.  I&#x27;m settled into the dining room computer today.  The smell of burning mineral oil still wafts through the air.  But don&#x27;t worry - there&#x27;s nothing weird or dangerous going on.  That&#x27;s just the final step in cleaning my cast iron pans.  One of them is clean, the other sits on the counter, still covered in a glistening layer of pork fat decorated with flecks of burnt rice.  I think I&#x27;ll save that second pan for later in the day when I need a mental break.

               Sip.  Things have been good lately.  The air feels chilly, and even though it&#x27;s hard to leave the comfort of your warm sheets in the morning, it helps to have a good breakfast to look forward to.  In our house, Eggo waffles are all the rage.

               [figure waffles]

               Marissa, determined to make the most of what may be our last swell of warm weather, spent some time outside with our wayward rain gutter that spills into the yard.  We call it the swamp, a phrase coined by Rodney.  The two of them filled it with rocks, and that should be good enough to keep the dogs from playing in the mud.

               [figure swamp]

               A question for the crowd - what are the best kinds of snacks to get at a Polish grocery store?  I ventured back last week in the evening just before they closed.  Vacuum sealed smoked trout, a whole aisle full of different pickled vegetables, and cookies from just about every country in Eastern Europe.  I panicked, grabbing a pack of palmiers and a tall beer from the shelf.

               [figure grocery-store]

               Rodney helped me cook pasta.  We made a simple red sauce with ground pork, onions, and mushrooms.  While I cooked the noodles, I tasked Rodney with stirring the sauce.  Maybe it was the extra involvement, but he got really into the sauce.  He took one burning hot bite after another, offering some to Miles and Marissa each time they walked by the stove.

               [figure sauce]

               We took the kids to a Hawks game - Miles&#x27; first hockey game.  Taking two kids a hockey game is no small feat.  Driving, parking, and walking... scanning tickets at the door and getting snacks... coordinating bathroom breaks and keeping them in their seats for three periods of hockey.  &quot;We&#x27;re cool parents&quot;, we quietly repeated as kind of a tounge-in-cheek salute to our herculean effort.

               [figure madison-ave]

               In honor of kids night, the team set up games in the lobby.  We played a round of giant tic-tac-toe.

               [figure tictactoe]

               The boys added their touch to a giant marker mural.  Miles left colorful smudges behind him while he fidgeted and scooted around on his butt.

               [figure mural]

               We tried our luck at hockey stick ski ball.

               [video swing]

               Climbing the steep stairs of section 3 with two beers in my hands and two bags of popcorn tucked under my arm, I lost my footing.  Beer splashed on my jersey and down my legs.  But it was a good game, and a tiring day at the United Center with kids still beats a day spent anywhere else.

               [figure game]

               That&#x27;s what I got.  Have a great Monday, friends.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everybody.  I regret to inform you that Monday has arrived.  If you&#x27;re like me, climbing out of bed on this chilly, overcast fall morning went against all of your instincts.  But nothing greases the tracks of my morning routine like a hot cup of coffee.  Wake up, fellow pilgrim, and imbibe.

               Sip.  Today is real picture day.  Marissa wanted to follow up on the whole picture day outfit debacle from a week ago.  &quot;Tell them that I got an email from Rodney&#x27;s old school in Madison - they&#x27;re picture day was last week,&quot; she explained.

               &quot;Yeah, maybe you should just write your own journal,&quot; I snipped.

               Rodney sat at the kitchen table over a hot plate of waffles in the same outfit from last week - khaki pants, a red plaid shirt, and a hair pushed aside with a glob of hair gel.  He ignored his waffles while he finished a game on his handheld Pac-Man.  If I were Rodney, I might feel a little embarrassed that the whole class already got to see my picture day outfit, but I think Rodney is still too young to be that conscientious.  He&#x27;s got other things on his brain.

               &quot;Didya know,&quot; he began after finally biting into a waffle.  &quot;Dida know that I can play videos in my head?&quot;

               How was your weekend?  Was it relaxing?  Marissa took Ziggy to an agility trial.  She returned with two ribbons.  Meanwhile, I hung out with the boys back at home.  Although we were limited to things within walking distance of our house, we still got a few adventures in.

               For example, the three of us are now regulars at the local Burger King.  I tried to convince Rodney and Miles to take a chance on Chinese, Mexican, or Kebabs, but there was no convincing them once they had BK on the brain.  Plus, Burger King is a lot closer than the other places, and I was getting tired of pulling them in the wagon.

               The boys talked me into going to Burger King twice this weekend.  Both times, we sat on one of the plush couches in the back just beneath the flat screen TV.  They were free to do whatever they wanted as long as they followed my very lenient dad brand of rules: let me watch TV, don&#x27;t run, and eat some of the food.

               I never thought I&#x27;d eat at Burger King again.  After all, we were reluctant neighbors to a Burger King during our time in Madison.  I weighed my principles while I ate the first whopper I&#x27;ve had in years, and I&#x27;ve decided to forgive Burger King.  Besides, the Burger King on the other side of our fence in Madison was so half-assed that it felt like a different restaurant altogether.

               On the way back, I took the boys to a Polish grocery store across the street.  We perused the aisles, trying to stay out of people&#x27;s way while we enjoyed the upbeat dance music thumping in the background.  We encountered a display of loose Polish candy, so I let the boys fill up a bag.

               Back at home, sampling the candy around the kitchen table felt exciting.  With barely a hint from pictures on the Polish wrappers, we had no idea what we were biting into.

               &quot;AH AH AH,&quot; yelled Rodney, shooting up from his seat at the table.  He began to cough as red liquid dribbled out of his mouth.  He ran to the garbage can in a panic and began spitting.  &quot;That one was had with spicy pepper sauce!&quot; he exclaimed.

               The label read &quot;cherry liquor&quot; in plain English print.  My bad - I probably could have spared him from that traumatic experience.

               I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of joy from grocery shopping.  When it comes to buying food, there are so many interesting choices around us.  Lately Rodney and I frequent the Valli Produce on the north side of town - or as he cryptically referred to it, &quot;the place with the black ceiling.&quot;  I vetted his memory during our last visit - I would have never noticed it, but Valli Produce does have a black ceiling!

               [figure shopping]

               During our last trip, I let Rodney take the lead with the kids cart.  He only bumped into about fifty people.  I think Rodney likes Valli because they have a whole freezer full of loose shrimp that they sell by the pound, and he gets to scoop his favorite food into a bag himself.

               [figure cooking]

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Go have a Monday.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Happy Thursday.  The smell of fresh coffee wafts over the air.  Tiny plastic keys and metal switches clack as my fingers dance across the keyboard.  The mood is right - I think it&#x27;s time to write.

               I almost skipped writing today.  But despite the odds, I sat down to knock out a journal entry.  Writing in the morning has been tough for all sorts of reasons.  First, I discovered that I really enjoy watching the morning news.  Even though the news runs all day, the morning news carries an extra dash of silliness and optimism.  The charming WGN news team wields a kind of psychological power over my tired brain, and in the moment I have to decide whether or not I&#x27;m writing, I yearn for a luxurious hour of mindlessly starting at the TV with a cup of coffee on the couch.

               It&#x27;s also become a real temptation to save writing for when life feels worth writing about.  I hold my reflections until I have some cute pictures in the camera roll or some thoughtful stories to tell about Rodney, Miles, and Marissa.  I think we all feel this strong gravitational pull of social media, and the temptation to curate our best moments for the public never goes away - not even my journal is immune!

               Yesterday, standing a few feet away from the keyboard in my bathrobe, I sighed just loudly enough for Marissa to hear me, hoping she would give the final word on whether I was going to write or collapse on the couch.  &quot;Do what gives you joy,&quot; she wisely commented.

               This writing routine doesn&#x27;t give me immediate joy.  It&#x27;s a delayed joy.  I don&#x27;t feel it until I&#x27;m already halfway through my work day, and I spend a twenty minute mental break clicking through my website.  I look at old pictures, read stories, and sometimes I catch myself laughing.  By far, my favorite entries are from the big streak where I went over a year without missing a single day.  There were lots of mornings when I didn&#x27;t feel like writing.

               These days, I&#x27;m seeking some kind of middle ground.  I enjoy the occasional lazy morning to slurp coffee and stare at WGN, but I also make it a point to write on the days when I really don&#x27;t feel it.

               I changed things up this morning.  I showered right when I woke up just to escape the comfort of my bathrobe.  I set up at the family computer so that it wouldn&#x27;t feel so much like work.  And now that I&#x27;m looking around, I&#x27;ve noticed that my coffee could use a top-off.  Let&#x27;s do this.

               Sip.  Doesn&#x27;t Rodney look spiffy?  There he is in his natural habitat sporting his picture day outfit.  We took him to Target the night before.  Marissa wanted him to wear blue plaid because it played off his eye color nicely.  I made the mistake of grabbing a second plaid shirt that boldly proclaimed his favorite color.  &quot;He looks like a lumberjack,&quot; sighed Marissa as she slung the blue shirt back on the rack.  Rodney may look like a lumberjack, but we decided that gaining enough of his trust to convince him to willingly wear a button down shirt was worth it.

               The only problem was that it wasn&#x27;t picture day.  We got our days crossed, unwittingly sending Rodney to a regular school day in this outfit.  When he lept off the bus at the end of the day, he boldly and loudly proclaimed that mom and dad were totally, utterly wrong about picture day.

               [figure say-cheese-napkin]

               The kids have been difficult this week.  If I could show you with a single moment, it would have to be this snapshot of a chaotic dinner at Naf Naf (we just discovered this place - it&#x27;s kind of like a Mediterranean Chipotle).

               [figure restaurants]

               Rodney barely touched his food, and he refused to stay in his seat for longer than 10 seconds.  Miles, seconds away from a meltdown, loudly pleaded his argument for why he should be allowed to exclusively eat the plain pita in the bag under Marissa&#x27;s tray instead of the one on his own tray that was mixed with sauce and chicken.  I was just trying to mentally block out the noise so I could inhale my own delicious pita pocket in peace.  Miles threw his sauce-dripping fork at me, snapping me out of my trance.  Meanwhile, Rodney stashed his stuffed raptor under the table, and Marissa would have to drive back to the store to retrieve it from the closing crew.  When we put the kids to bed after nights like these, I battle thoughts like how much longer before my kids just act like normal goddamn people?

               Later that night after the kids went to bed, I treated myself to a little spider project to lift my mood.  Tio&#x27;s enclosure has been bugging me for a while - it was one of the first bioactive setups I tried, and I totally goofed up the drainage layer.  Additionally, the plant was getting too big for the little glass box.  The ends of the roots were dying, and I read that this attracts gnats.  In this picture, you can see a displeased Tio curled up in a leaf, probably trying to avoid the swampy dirt beneath him.

               [figure enclosure]

               What kind of re-housing would this be?  Would Tio go quietly?

               [figure hiding]

               I should have just left Tio in the lid where he felt safe.  In hopes of getting him a deli cup, I nudged him one last time with a paint brush.  He took off across the table, down the table leg, and onto the carpet.  For an uncomfortable flash of time, we had an exotic Brazilian spider running free in our dining room.  I could have sworn that I felt a crunch when I brought down the deli cup, but Tio still has all eight legs.  Thank God spiders are tough.

               [figure captured]

               I washed out his enclosure, rinsed his old cork bark hide with cold water, and rebuilt a better home - no plants this time, but I left a few tatters from his old leaf as a memento.  I&#x27;m thankful for spiders - they make life interesting.

               That&#x27;s what I got today - have a good Thursday everyone, and in case I decide to space out and watch WGN tomorrow morning, have a good weekend.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  How&#x27;s your Monday going so far?

               Today I&#x27;m checking in from my bright and sunny corner of Marissa&#x27;s art studio.  Rodney has the day off school, and out of all of us, I&#x27;m the only member of the family that needed to wake up early today.  Marissa, accompanied by the dogs, scores an extra hour of sleep.  Rodney chose not to sleep in, but to instead spend the morning bantering with Miles from across the hallway.

               It&#x27;s a regular Monday for me, so I had better get to it.  But first - how about a journal entry, and even before that, a big sip of this fresh coffee?

               Sip.  I have some big news to catch you up on, and it has to do with that 2008 Honda CRV that was sitting in my garage three days ago.  Last week, while coming back from our trip to the West loop (remember when we had to pick up my soap?), we had some car trouble.  Lights flickered on the dashboard as the faulty vehicle stability assistant clicked into action.  The sick engine throbbed as the vehicle slowed to a crawl.  We&#x27;ve known about the faulty VSA, and the same thing had already happened a few times in Madison, but on the mean, unforgiving interstates of Chicagoland, it felt like the car put us in a new type of danger.

               &quot;It&#x27;s time,&quot; said Marissa.  &quot;Let&#x27;s just go visit a dealership and see what we can get.&quot;

               Even though we declared our intent was just to &quot;look&quot;, I knew we were coming home with a new car.  I snapped one last photo of our family&#x27;s trusty sidekick in its natural habitat.

               [figure crv]

               It was time for this car to go, but not without the respect it deserves.  Even though all the engine issues we&#x27;ve been having lately were frustrating, I can&#x27;t deny that this car served faithfully.  Over one hundred ninety thousand miles.  This car moved us across state lines and took both our kids home from the hospital.  Sitting in the passenger seat on our way to Carmax, Marissa counted all the states we&#x27;ve visisted on her fingers.  &quot;Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigain... pretty much all over the midwest,&quot; she laughed.

               The Carmax employee read off the list of irreparable damage found in the appraisal.  &quot;Peeling paint, rust all over the wheels and bumper, hail damage on the roof,&quot; he recited.  Even though he was trying to justify the pitifully low trade in price, the rap sheet just made me feel proud.  You can&#x27;t expect a fourteen year old car that has been parked outside through six harsh Wisconsin winters to look as pretty as the other cars glimmering in the front lot.

               Trapped at a Carmax all day, I had plenty of time to reflect on what the CRV has meant for our family.  The process took a lot longer than we expected.  Marissa and I even had to leave halfway through to pick up Rodney.  He and Miles played in the corner while Marissa and I finished up with the salesman.  At last, he led us over to the garage where our new minivan was parked alongside our old car.

               &quot;Now I&#x27;m feeling emotional,&quot; I said, giving the Honda one final lookover.  &quot;This is tough.  It&#x27;s like saying goodbye to the millenium falcon or something.&quot;

               &quot;Actually, if it were the Millenium falcon, you would be seeing it again,&quot; corrected the salesman.  Marissa shot me a tired look.  Our rapport with the Carmax salesman was getting a little stale, and we were grateful it was almost time to go home.

               The Recker family has a new ride now.  You can barely hear the engine while it coasts down the street.  The trunk is big enough for Miles and Rodney to walk around in like an airplane cabin.  There are approximately a hundred cup holders.  The old CRV has treated us well over the years, but we had no idea what we were missing.

               [figure odyssey]

               In other news, we took the boys to the nearby farm for some classic fall fun.  Ours is called Goebbert&#x27;s farm.  On the walk over, Marissa and I puzzled about this weird tradition.  Hay rides, corn mazes, apple picking, and climbing on old tractors.  They&#x27;re all slightly too expensive, but they&#x27;re a lot more fun if you commit to a whole day.  Whatever - it was something to do, and Marissa and I were eager to burn some calories with piggie back rides.

               [figure walking]

               This farm had lots of animals.  Alpacas, Ibanezes, goats, sheep, and a giraffe.

               [figure alpaca]

               We found the perfect place in line in front of the giraffe pen.  We didn&#x27;t want to spend an extra four dollars on a cup of dirty carrots.  Thinking on her feet, Marissa scooped some unused carrots off the floor, and we got a photo op anyway.

               [figure giraffe]

               Miles is still recovering from his flu.  He&#x27;s fine during the day, but the coughing and sniffling keeps him up late into the night.  The other night around 11 PM, I found him wide awake in his crib.  So I decided to invite him out into the living room.

               It&#x27;s fun watching little kids try to figure out what time it is. Miles didn&#x27;t know what to do with himself.  We sat there on the couch staring at Miles.  Miles smiled back and sat in the middle of the floor.

               &quot;Make your funny face,&quot; I commanded.

               [figure late]

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Have a great day, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Hey everybody, good morning.  It&#x27;s nice to reach the middle of the week.  The truth is I probably should have started writing a few minutes ago, but I got too damn comfortable lounging around with coffee in the dining room.  First, Minnie fell asleep on my lap.  Then Marissa and I started making plans for the weekend.  All the while, we watched with amusement while a tired Rodney nodded off at the breakfast table over a bowl of dry honey comb.

               &quot;Why are you so tired today, dude?&quot; I asked.  Rodney blinked, uninterested.

               &quot;I think somebody stayed up a little too late circling things in the Christmas catalog we got in the mail,&quot; teased Marissa.

               I poured Rodney another shot of apple juice, thinking the sugar would wake him up.  I thought about giving him a sip of coffee.  Mornings like these must be tough on a kid.  Just imagine if you were tired and you didn&#x27;t even get the help of freshly brewed morning stimulants.

               Sip.  How&#x27;s the week treating you so far?  I&#x27;ve been hacking away at a particularly thorny technical problem at work.  So to break up day and give my brain some peace, I took a midday drive into the city.  I love driving into the city.  Barreling down the sunny highway while the glimmering Chicago skyline grows out of the horizon - the drive itself is a good enough reason.  But yesterday&#x27;s flimsy excuse to take a short road trip was to pick up my soap.

               At Marissa&#x27;s last spring show, we struck friendship with Faye, a local soap vendor.  I bought one of Faye&#x27;s soaps to commemorate our new friendship.  But the feel, aroma, and quality of her soap was so undeniably real (especially compared to my usual cheap bottle of Old Spice body wash), I had to buy another.

               Marissa and I walked after Miles, who confidently tottled through Fulton Market.

               [figure walking]

               Faye pulled over at the curb, jumped out of her car, and gave us a big hug.  We got to chatting about art shows.  Sadly, she couldn&#x27;t get off the wait list for the next show, and the whole interaction with the event organizers rubbed her the wrong way.  &quot;I&#x27;m sorry - I&#x27;ll get off my soap box now,&quot; she said grinning, giving plenty of time for the soap pun to land.

               How&#x27;s your soap supply?  Maybe you should head over to [Janvier] and take a look at the supply.  The &quot;Soap Queen&quot; has something for everyone.

               After picking up my soap, we took Miles to a donut shop.  It took exactly 10 minutes for our son to wolf down the vanilla bean glazed ring.

               [figure donuts]

               Back at home, Marissa finished up Rodney&#x27;s bedroom mural.  I could have sworn she was already done with it, but as I&#x27;ve learned from watching her work, you never really finish a piece of art - you just have to sort of walk away from it.

               &quot;I think I&#x27;m secretly making my own childhood dream come true,&quot; admitted Marissa.  &quot;I mean NO, there&#x27;s NOTHING psychological going on.  Me and Rodney just like dinosaurs.&quot;

               [figure mural]

               Marissa and I embarked on a small diet in the month of October - just to curb all the eating tourism that took place this past summer after a stressful move.  I took a brisk evening walk to Jewel to pick up some light beer.  I used to take brisk evening walks in Madison too, and one of the biggest differences I&#x27;ve noticed between Madison and Schaumburg is walkability.  No, that&#x27;s not just a nonsense term that realtors throw around to make an area seem charming.  It&#x27;s real, palpable, and the difference is felt in the details.  Walking around my old neighborhood in Madison, the craggly sidewalks took me underneath trees, through brush, and along running water.  It was like the natural habitat was there first and we humans had to humbly meander around it.

               Here in the suburbs of Chicago, nature is sparse.  If you want to walk through trees, flowers, and shrubs, you have to go drive to a nature reserve.  If you try to walk there, you&#x27;ll have to first brave a narrow sidewalk that flanks a busy road.  No turns, twists, or change in scenery either - just a straight walk interrupted by the occasional pause waiting for a signal at a busy intersection.

               But even a straight walk along a busy road can be kind of meditative.  You get a nice breeze from the cars whizzing by on the road.  And it&#x27;s not like there are zero trees - just look at this beautiful, exuberant pine I found.  Never mind that it&#x27;s growing right over the sidewalk.

               [figure sidewalk-tree]

               Once I get to Jewel, I have to cut over the hill through some grass, ducking under a few more pine trees.  But beside the roped off pile of sharp metal and stack of construction barricades, there&#x27;s a port-a-potty in case I ever have to relive myself - a thoughtful touch, isn&#x27;t it?

               [figure sidewalk-bathroom]

               Some of my Madison friends got a good laugh at the street view of Schaumburg&#x27;s town square.  Doesn&#x27;t this look cozy?  Want to go sit in the shade of our little clock tower and listen to the rumbling of cars?

               [figure square]

               Low walkability, but I love this place for other reasons.  Thanks for stopping by today, and have a great Wednesday everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everybody.  Welcome to Monday.  Once I finished brewing coffee, showering, and getting settled, the house fell silent.  The cold, morning air in my corner of the studio chills my feet.  The buzz of my little electric gnat trap lulls me into focus.  But if I really want to get my brain cells percolating, I&#x27;m going to need one more crucial ingredient.

               Sip.  Ah, there it is.  The coffee hits different today.  I dipped into some of my birthday Amazon money to treat myself to a new coffee grinder.  The little $10 blade grinder it replaced has no reason to feel shame, but it simply can&#x27;t compete with the smooth, quiet motor that gently crushes coffee beans into an even powder.  Plus, the automatic timer is a lot more reliable, so for the first time in a while I&#x27;ve enjoyed the luxury of multi tasking in the kitchen while the coffee grinds.  Think of all the precious seconds I&#x27;m getting back!

               It&#x27;s been a weird morning so far.  All weekend, we&#x27;ve played cat-and-mouse with this pesky flu that Rodney picked up from school.  During the day, Rodney rough-houses with Miles, fiddles with toys, and plays in the yard.  But at night, he feels restless and feverish.  An hour ago, shivering in his bed, he blurted out one last lucid thought before drifting off to sleep.

               &quot;I think I need to go to the doctor on Wednesday - then we&#x27;re going to get a bowl of cheese balls and eat them on the couch together while we watch Zubumafu.&quot;

               He needs sleep, not cheese balls.  Plus, I finished all the cheese balls last night.

               Earlier in the night, he shot up in bed crying from a fever dream.  Marissa sat with him, and in hopes of cheering him up, I grabbed Miles out of his crib.  Miles had no appreciation for being let out of his crib at 10 PM.  Instead, Miles bolted straight into the kitchen and began making demands.

               [video milk]

               Rodney had another interesting dream.  A few days ago, when we thought he was on the mend, we had this exchange:

               &quot;I had a dream about Archer.  What was that place where you walk around outside and drink beer?&quot;

               &quot;The biergarten,&quot; I suggested.  &quot;The place we took you in Madison.&quot;

               Rodney went on.  &quot;Yeah, Archer and I were at the biergarten by ourselves after they closed.  We were just sitting by the water watching the sunset, and I just put my arm around him.&quot;

               We never met Archer at the biergarten, but the scene he described still felt profound.  Maybe Rodney doesn&#x27;t feel settled yet.  A big move, a new school, and different kids - Rodney&#x27;s fever dreams gave us a peak into the stress and uncertainty he&#x27;s battling.

               It&#x27;s a shame he&#x27;s been under the weather.  I would have love to take him to Chief Reptile.  Without my go-to copilot, I had to make the adventure to spend my birthday share of the family budget alone.  I stood like a statue in the back of the store, staring indecisively into their collection of spiders.

               [figure chief-reptile]

               I went with a juvenile Aphonopelma seemani.  I&#x27;ve wanted one in my collection ever since I recognized the species from the original Home Alone movie.  Even though the movie characterizes Buzz&#x27;s tarantula as a dangerous creature, I&#x27;ve heard the opposite - that they&#x27;re really docile.  Sure enough, this one wandered out of its deli cup like a timid puppy.  I&#x27;ve noticed that whenever I sit down at my desk, it walks out onto the flat dirt like it&#x27;s observing me.

               [figure seemani]

               In other news, Marissa had to send out a small package.

               [figure painting]

               This hanging, sculpted canvas piece needed to get to New York.  Marissa built a wooden crate in the garage.  We hosted a guessing pool to see who would get the weight right.

               For my birthday, we took the kids to a Hibachi restaurant.  They were dazzled by flying knives, spatulas, and shrimp tails.

               [figure hibachi]

               During the chef&#x27;s warm up routine, he dropped his spatula.  It went skittering off the table.  Rodney belted out the word &quot;MISTAKE&quot;.  For the rest of the routine, Rodney studied his actions closely, ready to call out any more mistakes.

               [figure hibachi-napkin]

               Let&#x27;s end the entry with some more napkin doodles.  Sometimes during the weekend when Rodney is too excited to fall asleep, I peek my head into his room for impromptu hand to hand combat.  We punch, kick, and wrestle.  I throw stuffed animals at him, and he uses his keen ninja reflexes to dodge them.  It&#x27;s an ongoing war - two ultimate warriors trying to settle an endless debate.  Who is stronger?

               [figure challenge-napkin]

               Hockey is back.  Out of all of us, Marissa is the most grateful.

               [figure kaner-napkin]

               It&#x27;s a shame Rodney had to stay home from school today.  He&#x27;s missing the first pizza Monday, and he&#x27;s also missing the opportunity to find this horrifying cartoon in his lunchbox today.

               [figure pizza-napkin]

               Have a great Monday, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Welcome to Tuesday.  How are you feeling today?

               It&#x27;s another perfectly chilly fall morning.  While I brewed coffee, Marissa tiredly leaned against the front window, waiting for the bus to pick up Rodney.  Rodney was waiting in a new spot today on our side of the street.  He claims that his teacher instructed them to hold off on crossing the street until the bus driver has a chance to stop and wave them across.  That&#x27;s all fine, but Rodney happened to pick a spot behind a tree where it would be impossible to spot him.

               &quot;He&#x27;s not gonna see you, honey,&quot; hollered Marissa through the cracked door.  &quot;Just... just cross the street like normal.&quot;

               So far I&#x27;ve learned that first grade is the awkward time where you have to learn to trust your kids to relay all the important things they&#x27;re hearing at school.  We hear about his homework assignments, upcoming events, and new rules indirectly through Rodney, and sometimes he leaves things a bit muddled.  Last week, they gave the kids a refresher on how to exit out the back of the bus in case of an emergency.  But the version we heard went something like, &quot;did you know that the bus will crash on the road?  And we have to jump out the back door&quot;.  Rodney was similarly spooked by the fire drills they practiced in kindergarten, and I&#x27;m noticing a theme.  He doesn&#x27;t yet understand the difference between simple preparedness and, um, inevitable impending doom.

               Where&#x27;s my coffee...

               Sip.  It&#x27;s my birthday week.  Since it falls on a Thursday this year, I decided to take Monday and Friday off and split the festivities into two days.  This Saturday, Marissa and I are going to grab dinner downtown at a secret location of her choosing.  Last Sunday, we went to a Bears game.  But before all that, we finally made good on our promise to take the boys to Build-a-Bear workshop.

               The tired workhorse of the Schaumburg economy, sometimes I worry about the future of the Woodfield Mall.  Next time I have these worries, I&#x27;ll have to remember to simply try to find parking there on a Saturday night.  Circling the lot for ten minutes, scanning each stall, I felt a little relieved that the Woodfield Mall was still a profitable, hectic bazaar where it is impossible to find parking.

               We wouldn&#x27;t linger.  There wouldn&#x27;t be more stops.  We walked directly into Build-a-Bear where Miles and Rodney got to work.  First they had to pick a &quot;teddy bear carcass&quot;, as I like to call it.

               [figure picking-a-bear]

               Next, the teddy bear carcass is filled with stuffing.  At the base of a giant, swirling, cloudy chamber of moving cloth, two friendly employees helped Miles and Rodney inflate their dinosaurs into real stuffed animals.  They each planted a ceremonious red heart in the middle before it was sewn shut.

               [figure stuffing-a-bear]

               &quot;That red heart will be a fun little prize for Minnie to find when she rips these things to shreds,&quot; I said quietly to Marissa.

               Two naked stuffed dinosaurs from Build-a-Bear weren&#x27;t so expensive.  But word to the wise, the accessories are where they get you.  Even holding Rodney and Miles to two small shirts and a skateboard to share, the final bill was steep - like buying a steak dinner for two, but all we had to show for it was these two goofy looking dinosaurs.

               [figure posing-with-bear]

               The sweet, albeit expensive trip to Build-a-Bear was their time.  The Bears game was our time.  Marissa and I painted our faces.  She borrowed a Jay Cutler jersey from my closet.

               &quot;If you really want to act the part, just walk around asking Where&#x27;s that hot guy from Very Cavallari,&quot; I teased.

               [figure facepaint]

               Even though I had only been to one Bears game myself, I did my best to recreate a staple gameday experience.  We would take the blue line into the city, then transfer and get off at Roosevelt.  It was almost a flawless arrival.  We missed the transfer and had to close the last bit of distance with an Uber.  But we still got to make the iconic, winding walk through the park that connects the Shedd, the Field Museum, and finally Soldier Field.

               Why does crossing a single street and walking to a football field need to be so complicated?  We filed across a bridge, under tunnels, down stair cases - the long, winding walk takes you in all four cardinal directions before you even get to the base of Soldier Field.  But the pounding of bucket drums and the barking of ticket scalpers while following a school of waddling Bears fans just helps build anticipation.

               &quot;That&#x27;s it?&quot; laughed Marissa.  &quot;It looks... like a mistake.&quot;  An honest reaction to the charming monstrocity.  It&#x27;s true that Soldier field looks a lot more beautiful from the inside.

               [figure soldier-field]

               In a weird way, it was the perfect Bears game.  It got hot, cold, and rainy all in the same half.  Our offense played atrociously, but we still managed to win with up-the-gut running, defensive takeaways, and a game-deciding field goal.  Bears football, baby!

               With a few more hours to kill before dinner, we took a walk through the Shedd aquarium.  Maybe that&#x27;s why they put Soldier field so close to the aquarium - what else are you going to do with the rest of the afternoon after watching a football game?

               It&#x27;s funny how each time you visit the aquarium, something new grabs your attention.  For me, this time it was the jellyfish - serenely floating in a big, circular tank with no rocks, reef, or decorations.  Just breathing, undulating in pure water.  &quot;You think the jellyfish get bored in their?&quot; I commented.

               [figure jellyfish]

               Marissa&#x27;s Shedd favorite has always been the belugas, but they seemed different this time.  &quot;They&#x27;re... lumpy,&quot; she laughed.  &quot;It&#x27;s like their skin isn&#x27;t filled up all the way.&quot;  I wondered if she was subconsciously thinking of that metal tube that inflated animals at build-a-bear.

               [figure beluga]

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Thanks for stopping by, and have a great Tuesday, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everybody.  Happy Friday.

               The little digital thermometer I have on my desk reads 65 degrees Ferenheit.  It&#x27;s funny how much of a difference just a few degrees makes, because this morning it feels like a totally new season - like autumn has finally descended.

               In fact, it was so cozy and chilly in the house that I decided to just leave my bathrobe on and jump right into writing.  Working at the computer in a bathrobe - does this set a dangerous precedent for my workdays?  Sometimes I joke with people that I&#x27;m a professional &quot;pajama worker&quot;, but I fear that might be coming true, especially with this final compromise on work attire.

               Whatever.  I don&#x27;t even have any Zoom meetings today.  Today, nobody will actually know if I decided to put on a real outfit.  Not even you, reader.

               Sip.  It&#x27;s a cozy day today, and it feels rewarding for the long week.  I didn&#x27;t even mention that our whole family has finished a round of dentist appointments.  Rodney&#x27;s routine cleaning was easy, and he took it in stride.  Marissa and I, on the other hand, worried about what was festering in our adult mouths.  Neither of us had been to the dentist since COVID.

               I feel like I got lucky.  I had no cavities, but the dentist found a spot in my teeth where the gums recede too far back.  &quot;It could be from grinding your teeth, brushing too hard, or it could just be genetic,&quot; she explained.  Long story short, I need to return later this month so they can patch it with a little piece of skin.  The teeth cleaning, as always, was excruciating, but at least I was done.

               Marissa wasn&#x27;t so lucky.  The dentist found three cavities and recommended an extra-deep gum cleaning spread out over two visits on top of another visit to remove the cavities.  Marissa has been to the dentist so many times this week that I&#x27;ve lost count of which visit she&#x27;s on, but she&#x27;s almost at the end of it.

               In other news, I&#x27;m getting back in the mood to play video games.  But Rodney and I had a problem - Miles broke one of our two Xbox controllers.  I decided I&#x27;d take Rodney to Gamestop in the mall.

               I knocked on Rodney&#x27;s door at the end of the hallway.  He was reading a book in his bed, wearing nothing but his underwear.  As I cracked open his door, a slip of paper fell to the ground.

               &quot;That says &#x27;Rodney is closed&#x27;,&quot; he said.

               &quot;Oh - sorry to interrupt, dude,&quot; I said politely.

               &quot;It&#x27;s OK,&quot; he replied.  &quot;It&#x27;s just for stealers to think that they can&#x27;t come in.&quot;

               I came into Rodney&#x27;s room to invite him on a spontaneous errand to the mall.  Knowing how badly he wanted to be rescued from quiet time, I dragged it out for my amusement.

               &quot;There&#x27;s this video game store in the mall, but I have a problem - I don&#x27;t have anyone to go with,&quot; I said.

               Before I had even made my point, Rodney sprung out of bed and put on clothes.

               A few minutes later, we&#x27;d find ourselves at Gamestop in Woodfield Mall.  The employee smugly informed us that Xbox 360 consoles, supplies, and games have been completely taken out of all Gamestop stores.  The news took me off-guard.  The Xbox 360 isn&#x27;t &quot;new&quot; by any standard, but I&#x27;ve never thought of it as &quot;old&quot;.  Now that it&#x27;s been officially taken off the shelves at Gamestop, it&#x27;s officially places it in the &quot;retro&quot; category.

               So our trip to the mall was kind of a bust.  No longer without a purpose, we bought two bags of Dippin&#x27; Dots and ate them while we wandered around.  We passed by a console at the mall selling these little European legos.  Rodney set his icecream aside and immediately started fiddling with a demo set.  Like a shark catching the scent of blood, the toy salesman turned a corner and grinned at Rodney, waiting to be acknowledged.

               But Rodney didn&#x27;t look up.  He just kept fiddling with the bricks in front of them.  I didn&#x27;t acknowledge the salesman either - I just kept taking bites of my icecream, and I pulled out my phone to look through my emails.  We stood there for a few minutes sharing an awkward silence, then without warning Rodney pushed the blocks aside and we walked away.

               Have you ever been harangued by one of those salespeople at a mall?  One time at our mall in Madison these window cleaning people put the screws to me and Marissa.  Since then, anyone with a landyard, a clipboard, or a square reader, I make it a habit of walking around them in a wide circle.  But I&#x27;ve never thought about Rodney&#x27;s tactic - simply not saying anything.  Try that out next time.

               [figure horses: A picture with the horse statues on the way out]

               Yesterday as work was winding down, I was in the mood for another adventure with Rodney.  I found a retro gaming store closer to the city.

               &quot;I bet Facebook marketplace has controllers,&quot; said Marissa.  I opened a tab on my computer to humor her.

               &quot;Nope.  They don&#x27;t have any,&quot; I whined, pretending to ignore the dozens of results on the page.  &quot;We just want to go to a store where we have choices.&quot;

               &quot;You&#x27;re just gonna buy more games,&quot; laughed Marissa.

               I peaked my head in Rodney&#x27;s room.  He was fiddling with a tray of LEGO&#x27;s in bed.  &quot;You wanna drive to Chicago?&quot; I asked quietly.

               The question hit Rodney like a lightning bolt.  He flung open his closet and dug out a new pair of clothes, and once again we were off.

               We sat in traffic on I-90.  It wasn&#x27;t the most scenic drive, but we were both just glad to be out of the house.  Rodney filled my ear with his own contrived explanations - how the spinning tower was controlling airplanes in the sky, and how the blue &quot;I-90&quot; sign meant that this road was patrolled by 90 police officers.

               We parked down the street from the video game shop.  They had an N64 plugged into a small CRT monitor.  They had Rock Band guitars and drums on display.  Seeing an original Xbox, Xbox 360, and a Dreamcast behind glass beside an Atari and Super Nintendo pulled me deeper into the present reality that I was now officially one of those thirty year old retro gaming guys.  But at least I had my six year old son with me, so that made me feel less creepy.

               We brought home a good haul from the retro gaming store: two extra controllers as well as Tekken, the Kung Fu Panda game, and a Star Wars game.  It&#x27;s going to be a fun weekend.

               Thanks for stopping by today.  Go play some video games - you deserve it.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  I hope you&#x27;re gently waking up to this beautiful Wednesday.  If you were in our house and you were still sleeping, no doubt Ziggy&#x27;s desperate, jealous whelping would have done the job by now.  After Rodney trotted onto the bus, Marissa decided to get some agility time in the yard, taking each dog out one at a time.  High pitched barking, nails on the sliding back door - it must be Minnie&#x27;s turn right now.  The dog agility power rankings came back from this past weekend, and for the first time in her young career, Ziggy is 1st place for her breed.  It must have gone to her head.

               [figure rankings]

               But I&#x27;m across the hall in my office.  I&#x27;ve got an empty text buffer and a hot cup of coffee.  My own dog-like instincts take over - it&#x27;s time to write.

               Sip.  How about that rainbow yesterday?  The downpour came while Rodney and I were still out getting groceries.  Rodney pointed it out, but always fearful about when the next tornado is coming, he didn&#x27;t take any chances and bolted into the house through the side door.  I stayed outside in the rain and took some pictures.

               [figure rainbow]

               Can you see Rodney&#x27;s &quot;jet&quot; in the frame?  We donated that box to Rodney a few weeks ago.  He&#x27;s cut windows, attached wings, and added a few layers of duct tape.  Earlier this week, Marissa cut the boys loose with a box of fresh markers.

               [figure box]

               What are Rodney&#x27;s plans for the box?  I&#x27;m not sure, but the box is starting to cause a small family conflict.  We&#x27;re silently wondering when it&#x27;s OK to crumple the soft, damp mass of cardboard and tape into the garbage can.  Rodney would keep the box forever, turning it into a family heirloom.  The standoff continues at least until the next garbage day.

               In other news, I found a new way to cook fish, and the dish has taken over this week&#x27;s dinner menu.  The technique involves lining a pan with butter, cold fish, and diced shallots and covering the pan with a fluted piece of parchment paper.  You dump in just enough white wine to go halfway up the fish, and simmer gently until the fish is cooked through.  As a bonus, it makes your whole house smell amazing.

               [figure fish: Poached red snapper]

               I&#x27;ve tried the technique with cod, trout, and red snapper.  It feels like this recipe is impossible to mess up, and those are the kinds of recipes you want to keep close to your kitchen.  Here&#x27;s a link to the recipe, in case you want to try it yourself.

               &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/u3ypQ78brsM&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

               Sadly, no napkin doodle today.  Rodney is only at school for a half-day today, so I guess that means we&#x27;ll see him trotting up the driveway in just a few hours.  I had better get some quiet computer and coffee time in before then.  Hey, have a great Wednesday, everybody.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, friends.  Happy Monday.  How are you feeling today?

               We sent Rodney off to the bus stop almost an hour ago.  Marissa and I quietly chuckled, watching his skinny white legs shuffle across our cul-de-sac.  In all things, Rodney likes to choose his own path, and you can tell because he chooses a different walking path to the bus stop every day.  Sometimes he walks on the outside along the grass.  Sometimes he walks in a zig-zag.  It can be a curl route, a go route, or a deep slant.

               Sip.  Sorry, I&#x27;ve got football on the mind.  I set aside most of Sunday to watch football.  I was in my laziest form, sporting boxers and an old t-shirt under a blanket on the couch armed with a tv remote and a tall glass of ice water, and I would remain there most of the day.  We ordered a pizza, and we stayed up late watching the Bears-Packers game.  Then Marissa and I stayed up even later - probably as a form of therapy for another tough Packers loss.

               I didn&#x27;t wake up early to write about football, so I&#x27;ll leave yesterday&#x27;s game with one final observation.  It&#x27;s amazing how you can replace the manager, coach, staff, and nearly all the players of a team and they can still play the Packers with the exact same result.  Think about it - it&#x27;s a completely different group of people and players riding the team bus into Lambeau field, but somehow they do exactly the same thing as last year.  And there I&#x27;ll conclude the football portion of this entry.

               What else did we get up to this weekend?  For starters, we ran the final gauntlet of living room floor installation.  While Marissa and Ziggy ran at an agility trial and Rodney attended school, Miles and I endured one last day displaced from our living room.  Here&#x27;s a little sample of how the day went.

               [video fit]

               At the end of the video, I ask Miles to make his funny face.  I knew he&#x27;d decline.  His funny face is a rarity that only comes out when he&#x27;s in the best of moods.

               [video funny-face]

               I don&#x27;t want to compare my children&#x27;s behavior, but right now Miles is the bad one.  He&#x27;s officially surpassed Rodney in two year old stubbornness.  Back in the day, Rodney could throw a fit, but Miles has woven these into an art form.  He throws things on the ground.  He hits his head on the floor.  Under my care this weekend, he pried off the lid of his sippie cup and let the juice run into his bed.

               I had a dream last night.  I was back in a high school classroom, and from the dark curtains and wall of old books, I recognized my philosophy teacher Mr. Baldwin&#x27;s room.  But instead of Mr. Baldwin, an old woman was sitting in his arm chair in the front of the room.  &quot;How do you discipline a child?&quot; I asked in a squeaky high school voice.

               Maybe I&#x27;m feeling inspired by the TV psychology in The Sopranos, but from the dream it&#x27;s clear to me I&#x27;m thinking about discipline.  The high school classroom, the teacher, and the question made it feel like I was negotiating with my tradition - my instilled values.  Not in bad faith either, but from a sincere place.  It was like I was pleading for a higher authority to help me resolve something.  The dream ended before the old woman in the chair could respond.

               In hopes of shaking Miles out of his morning grumpiness, I took him to the park.

               Miles worked his magic on me.  He looked so innocent tottling around the playground that I began to wonder if I was the difficult one in this relationship.

               [figure swinging]

               In other news, we tried another church this weekend.  We parked on a quiet neighborhood street in Itasca.  We quietly ushered Rodney and Miles through the set of double doors.  We grabbed a seat in the back pew of the sanctuary which, to our horror and embarrassment, only held about ten people in attendance.  All ten of them turned around and stared us down while we got settled.

               &quot;Don&#x27;t make any noise now,&quot; said an awkward, nicely dressed man in front of us to Rodney.  A few minutes later, he walked to the end of the pew and grabbed a bag of crayons and a coloring book, gruffly tossing them to Miles.  Marissa grabbed one of the crayons and scribbled a discrete message on her program - the words LET&#x27;S GO?.

               I nodded enthusiastically.  We bagged up the crayons rolling around on the ground and made a brief, noisy exit out the back of the chapel.  Before we left, Rodney asked if he could take a piece of candy from the bowl by the door, and his voice echoed in the foyer.  Not a great church visit, but the nice thing about church hopping is that you reserve the right to peel out of the parking lot and never return if it goes really poorly.

               Wearing our church clothes, we went straight to Home Depot to buy some plywood.  Marissa ticked a chore off the list, and the boys got to get some of their wiggles out in a big empty hardware store - not a bad Sunday.

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Thanks for stopping by, and have a great Monday.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, friends.  Happy Thursday.  Waking up with coffee and enjoying the morning news on the couch, it&#x27;s hard not to be in a good mood after a slow morning like this one.  On Thursdays my team meets on zoom in the evening to make up for our sparse time zones, and I&#x27;ve really come to enjoy the effect it has on the rest of the day.  The morning is mine, whether I want to write, clean, slink around in my bath robe, or do a little of everything.

               Sip.  I think the real reason I&#x27;m in such a good mood is because the floor guys haven&#x27;t gotten here yet.  It&#x27;s been a busy week, and I&#x27;ve had a difficult time focusing with all the hammering, tearing, banging, and chatter from burly contractors across the hall.  But you tow a thin line when you complain about hired work in your house.  It feels like an invasion of space, but we paid them to be here.  It feels like an inconvenience, but they&#x27;ll be leaving a beautifully installed laminate floor behind them.  Making my emotions even more complicated, our contractor Marcin is a really nice guy.  He even offered to fix that ripped up gutter on our house free of charge.

               &quot;What would I charge you?  &quot;It&#x27;s going to take me ten minutes.  What, am I gonna add twenty bucks to your bill?&quot; he laughed boastfully.  &quot;I&#x27;d rather do something nice so you tell your friends about me.&quot;

               This week, my office has felt like my fragile refuge from all the chaos happening across the hall.  I&#x27;ve found peace staring into my new glass dubia roach tank.  There are no roaches here yet, but I think they&#x27;re going to like it.  No plastic bin, paper towels, or stack of old egg cartons.  Compared to those trappings, this is like the president&#x27;s suite of roach colonies.  A pile of clean, decorative drift wood lines the feeding pit.  A dark, humid rock cave gently bakes under the soft purple glow of a heat lamp.  I wanted to make a comfortable, natural habitat for happy free range dubia roaches.  Later this week, I&#x27;ll deploy the spring tails to get a jump on activating the soil.

               [figure roach-tank]

               It&#x27;s been a good food week.  Yesterday I was feeling burnt out from work, so I disconnected a little early to get a jump on dinner.  I was tackling the intimidating French staple dish coq au vin.  The quartered chicken pieces turned purple from marinating in red wine overnight, but it didn&#x27;t look so strange once they were seared and draped in a velvety brown sauce.  For style points, bits of rendered bacon and some caramelized knob onions.

               [figure coq-au-vin]

               It&#x27;s fun to show off in the kitchen sometimes, even if it&#x27;s just for your family.  But Marissa&#x27;s cupcakes stole the show.

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Have a great Thursday, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Happy Tuesday.  It&#x27;s been a busy last couple of days, but this morning I felt determined to write, even if that means focusing through the banging and clanging happening in the living room behind me.  I can hear our contractor Marcin mutter to his friend in Polish in between swings of a hammer.  One of the workers tosses their crowbar aside and it skitters across the tile floor.

               Tile?  Don&#x27;t we have carpet in our living room?  Ah, another piece of the puzzle drops into place.  The carpet is gone, and until Marcin&#x27;s crew install the new wood floor, we get to enjoy the funky aesthetic of the original tile.

               [figure living-room]

               The blue-green stripe running diagonally through the room surprised us.  Marcin suggested that they may have run out of one color of tile and tried to make up for the shortage with last second design.  In the meantime, it&#x27;s kind of fun having our own personal glimpse into the seventies or eighties.

               Our house feels a little up-ended right now.  We stuck our couch under the outdoor awning, the toys in the kitchen, and we had no choice but to temporarily scoot our TV into the bedroom.  The puppies nervously lurk in the background.  We wondered if they think we&#x27;re moving to a new house again.

               Sip.  Like I said, it&#x27;s been a busy past few days.  Last weekend, I joined my parents and my sisters on a visit to grandma.  The visit mostly commemorated her 90th birthday, but it was also to say farewell to the house she&#x27;s lived in for the last thirty years.  My aunts, uncles, and cousins were there.  For one last time, Grandma&#x27;s house was filled with our boistrous, beer-drinking nostalgia.  Apparently I was too busy chatting to get any pictures.  The only visual aid I returned with was a quick shot of the pond behind Grandma&#x27;s house.

               [figure lake]

               I used to fish with my dad and grandpa back here.  I&#x27;m pretty sure a few of my cousins have fallen into this lake too, and my cousin Jack reminded me of the mean swans that used to attack us.

               After the visit, Kelly hung out at our place while she waited for her flight back to Iowa.  We passed the time with a game of guess the person.  Kelly and Rodney swept us - an original Guess Who powerhouse duo.

               [figure kicking]

               &quot;It needed the big ones,&quot; he said, holding up the plastic bag of D batteries from our electronics stash.  &quot;Flat side on the spring.&quot;  Before I could check his work, he flipped the switch and the track whirred to life.

               [figure racing]

               The other day, Rodney got into another trance modifying a cardboard box in his room.  He stole a roll of blue painters tape from the drawer and, much like what his mother was doing in the studio, fashioned his own &quot;fabric&quot; to make the wing of a jet.

               [figure jet]

               Some sadder news - I lost my first spider.  Lalo, my Lasyodora parahybana, would suffer an untimely death long before he ever got to reach his adult bird-eater size.  I found him at the bottom of his hole with his legs curled underneath him.  It&#x27;s difficult to know exactly when a spider dies, but the trademark &quot;death curl&quot; is a good hint that a spider is on their way out.  I did what I could, leaving Lalo gently draped over a soaked paper towel in a deli cup hoping that the warm garage air would zap him back to life.

               [figure lalo]

               Lalo was a good, busy little spider.  He had an insatiable appetite.  He built an ambitious burrow that reached all the way to the floor of his plastic box.  I thought he would make it, but for some spiders it&#x27;s not in the cards.  Small spiders are the kind of pet whose survival isn&#x27;t guaranteed, but taking care of them in the first place gives them the best chance.  Rest in peace, Lalo.  Take a final stroll down the rainbow bridge, then get to work finding those cockroaches in Heaven.

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  How about we end the entry on a silly note with some new napkin doodles.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, friends.  Happy Thursday.  I hope you&#x27;re all staying healthy and well-rested out there.  This morning, I&#x27;m reporting from my office chair, hoping to make a quick transition to the work day to make up for a late start this morning.  Ollie sleeps at my feet with his face pressed against a cool patch of drop cloth in the studio half of the room.  My hair still feels wet from the shower, and I&#x27;m down to my last pair of clean sweatpants in laundry.  Even though I sit in front of a big, sunny window, I caught myself staring - of all places - into my desktop wallpaper.  I guess you can&#x27;t blame me, it&#x27;s a very beautiful picture I took in Amsterdam.  Little moments like this tell me it&#x27;s been too long since I&#x27;ve been on a plane.  I&#x27;ve been bit by the travel bug.

               [figure wallpaper]

               &quot;Are you going to absolutely roast me for what I did to the coffee?&quot; asks Marissa as she shuffles by the door across the hallway.  I think at this point, she expects me to write about all her trademark coffee machine mishaps.  But compared to all the others, this one wasn&#x27;t even the most egregious.  I brewed up a pot, then got the second pot ready.  Without realizing there was already a full pot of coffee waiting for her to enjoy, she simply hit the button again.  The pot overflowed, making a tranquil little brown river that ran down the counter and cascaded onto the floor.  Not her worst - the court of Alex&#x27;s blog feels merciful today, and we&#x27;ll let it slide.

               Sip.  Not much to report around here lately.  I&#x27;m on the last day of a short week, so no work tomorrow.  Marissa, Miles, and I might use the extra day off to go couch shopping.

               Yesterday was a pretty normal day, in that I kept my ass in this chair catching up on slack messages and working on tickets.  But I got to take a drive to Arlington Heights to drop a painting off to one of Marissa&#x27;s customers.  I careened north up highway 53, ducking out eastbound onto Euclid Avenue.  I used to make the exact same drive to high school every morning, and it was fun to watch that muscle memory take over.  The drive also took me past the Arlington Racetrack, which was recently deemed the future site of the new Bears stadium.  The gates were chained shut.  The main building, a few hundred feet off the main road, looked ominously abandoned.  Thinking of a brand new football stadium and entertainment district in that spot made me wonder if the drive on northbound 53 would ever feel so smooth and fun again.

               After Rodney got home from school, I set him up at the table with his homework.  That&#x27;s right - he has homework now.  Each school day this week he&#x27;s brought home a single page from his math workbook.  In a hurry to enjoy his snack and binge YouTube, Rodney rushed through his work.  He walked the scribbled work sheet around the corner to my office.

               &quot;You didn&#x27;t follow the instructions,&quot; I said.  &quot;It says to draw pictures to solve the problems.&quot;

               &quot;We don&#x27;t need to do that,&quot; he shrugged.

               &quot;Uh, I disagree, dude,&quot; I laughed.  &quot;It says it right here.&quot;

               Rodney took another pass at the math work sheet.  &quot;I don&#x27;t want to draw fish, I&#x27;m just going to draw circles,&quot; he qualified.

               Later before heading to bed, Rodney succinctly summed up his first impressions of homework.  &quot;Math makes me happy - I&#x27;m really good at it.  But... can I say a grown up word?&quot; he asked.

               I knew exactly what was coming.  &quot;Sure thing,&quot; I nodded.

               &quot;I hate writing,&quot; he said quietly.  &quot;It makes my hand tired.&quot;

               After we got the kids to bed, I took a late night walk to Jewel.  The grocery store is a soothing place in the evening.  Even though I just had to grab a loaf of bread, I contently made a slow lap around the whole store just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t missing any new snacks.  Ripe peaches, a bag of Garret&#x27;s popcorn, and a cup of salsa with a cartoonish label that read the SALSA king of Chicago - I just had to judge that title for myself.

               The Jewel meat aisle is a sight to behold.  Steaks, pork ribs, shoulders, brisket, wagyu, hams, and oxtail.

               [figure meat]

               But can I shed light on one of the greatest mysteries of my local Jewel?  They never have any chicken thighs.  They have a few of the expensive, organic ones, but no standard chicken thighs.  Doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal at first, but just look at home many chicken breasts they have for sale.

               [figure breasts-1]

               This is only one of four cases, and they&#x27;re eached packed with wrapped, hand-trimmed chicken breast.  Dozens - maybe fifties or hundreds of breasts.  But where are all the thighs?

               &quot;They sell out really quickly,&quot; the butcher told me.  &quot;I don&#x27;t get it either.&quot;

               I wish I took another minute to press the point of how weird this was.  I visit Jewel at least four times a week, and I&#x27;ve never seen any thighs for sale.  What the hell is going on?  Who is buying up all these chicken thighs?

               It&#x27;s time to start the work day, but how about a napkin before we go.  This is Miles, re-imagined as a little drooling robot.  Have a great day, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Happy Tuesday.  I&#x27;m writing from my office chair today, where I share the company of a big sunny window, a bunch of hairy spiders, and an icy, cold cup of Starbucks espresso.  I ran out this morning to re-up on beans, and I couldn&#x27;t resist getting a drink.

               &quot;It&#x27;s a reward for leaving the house,&quot; I told myself.  A cup of coffee as a reward for buying more coffee.  Does that make sense?  Only in a twisted, caffeine addicted way, sure.

               I love espresso.  This used to be my go-to drink before starting my shift at Starbucks.  Even to this day, a few shots over ice can lull me into a quiet, working mood.

               Sip.  That&#x27;s the good stuff.

               It&#x27;s a new week, and coming off a holiday we have a whole day advantage.  I need a fresh start.  Last week, I tried to get back on the horse a little too soon after fatefully underestimating the lingering effects of covid symptoms.  I tried to convince everyone that I was back in action, but this stinking disease would have me asleep in bed just a few short hours later.  &quot;Oh I&#x27;m ready to get back to work... as long as I can squeeze in a three hour nap,&quot; I joked.

               The sore throat was done, and we even left the CDC recommended window of contagiousness, but COVID brings a lot of weird, lingering symptoms that we&#x27;d come to learn about first hand.  For instance, have you heard of &quot;COVID teeth&quot;?  I woke up every morning with sore, aching gums, feeling like an eager dentist just went to town on my mouth while I was asleep.  Marissa found a source online that said the persistent sinus pressure would do that.  Ironically, this &quot;covid teeth&quot; effect made me decide to pick up flossing again.  My teeth were already in pain, so I may as well get some hygiene out of it.

               Or how about bad sleep?  It took us forever to fall asleep, and once we were asleep, waking up again felt impossible.  I thought I was to blame for wrecking my sleep cycle with all the long-tail midday naps, but people in my family tell me that COVID is known to mess with sleep.

               And of course, COVID had a mysterious knack for siphoning away my energy.  Laying on the couch all day made it easy to convince myself I was ready to get back to daily life, but with COVID even just sitting on a couch expends energy.

               It feels good to be back - really back.  This dark, swirling glass of espresso is doing the trick, but the holiday weekend helped too.  On Sunday, after taking it easy all morning, we ventured out into the world to check out Septemberfest - the annual fair in Schaumburg.  I attended this same fair all throughout my own childhood and teen years I spent in Schaumburg, and for old timers like me they kept everything exactly the same.  Rusted metal.  Rickety, grinding gears.  Chipped paint and faded colors.

               How do you feel about roller coasters?  These old school Midwestern fairs seem to reach a new level of terror.  As the groaning steel ferris wheel hoisted our tired carriage into the air, the knowledge that all of this machinery was temporary made the speed and heights even more thrilling.

               [figure terror]

               I know this picture makes it look like the ferris wheel terrified Miles, but he was crying for a wholly different reason.  He wanted to stand on the seat and look over the plastic barrier, but Marissa held him down with her arms wrapped tight around his waist like bun-gee chords.  The ferris wheel is more of an adult ride, anyway.  Where else can you get a view like this?

               [figure view]

               As a family, we agreed that the most thrilling ride was the dead-eyed, grinning caterpillar.  It went just fast enough to make us feel like the flimsy seat belt bar was more of an honorary safety measure.  The track plummeted sharply downward, and each time we circled the ride the same pair of rusty pliers lying on the pavement caught my eye.

               [video coaster]

               It was hard not to pay attention to the racket that is carnival economy.  You can&#x27;t just pay for rides.  You have to first launder your own money into tickets, which this year were digitized in little credit cards.  Somehow, you&#x27;re always one ticket short of another ride.  But even getting frustrated with the constant scamming and nickel-diming felt kind of nostalgic - what trip to the fair would be complete without a bit of a shakedown?

               [figure fishing]

               [figure funhouse]

               Night fell, and we walked through a rowdy high school crowd back to our car.  Caramel corn, cotton candy and funnel cakes had Miles and Rodney reeling from sugar, but they convinced me to stop for icecream on the way home anyway.  Septemberfest week is time to splurge - one last helping of summer before the season changes.

               Thanks for stopping by today.  Have a great week, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Happy Thursday.  I haven&#x27;t written a journal entry in a while, and my excuse is pretty simple - coronavirus.  Ever heard of it?  By now, I made it through the uncomfortable stuff - the headaches, the fatigue, and the muscle cramps.  Sitting here at my desk this morning, it just feels like I&#x27;m on the mend from a routine cold.  I&#x27;ve been sneezing a lot, but who doesn&#x27;t enjoy a good sneeze once in a while?

               Sip.  It&#x27;s hard to believe we avoided catching COVID for almost two years.  I would have liked to have the satisfaction of a glaringly positive test, but you know how dodgy those at-home tests can be.  I swabbed my nose twice - nothing.  Marissa&#x27;s test, on the other hand, was an enthusiastic positive.  &quot;My little bar even showed up before the control group,&quot; she boasted.

               [figure covid-test]

               Marissa, Miles, and I snivvled and napped our way through the week.  I felt bad for Rodney.  Somehow, he didn&#x27;t catch it, and as his school advised, he continued to show up to class everyday.  We barely went outside, reserving our energy for helping Rodney memorize his mailing address and study for his math test.  We at ready-made soup from Jewel all week.  I felt bad for Rodney.

               Not a lot of adventure this week, but before COVID put the brakes on our home life, we got into some good adventures.  The day before I found out I was sick, I took Miles chair shopping at Staples.  I knew he&#x27;d be grateful to tag along, but I didn&#x27;t expect him to be so opinionated about chairs.  He practically ordered me around, threatening to throw a fit if I stood up before he had a chance to sit next to me.

               [figure chair-shopping]

               This past weekend, we set up for Marissa&#x27;s last summer show in Highland Park.  Taking walks around the festival to pick up food and drop things off for Marissa, I got plenty of chances to take in the tranquil scenery of the little Chicago adjacent town.

               [figure highland-park-scene-0]

               &quot;Look at this building,&quot; I said to Marissa, holding out my phone.  &quot;I can&#x27;t figure out what it is.&quot;  A wikipedia article later told me this is the iconic Highland Park water tower - not to be confused with the similar one in Minneapolis, which weirdly is also called the Highland Park water tower.

               [figure highland-park-scene-1]

               Following the awful shooting that happened here just two months ago, we wondered if this art show would feel any different.  Flower memorials, sidewalk chalk murals, and &quot;Highland Park Strong&quot; window signs testified to the town&#x27;s quiet resolve.  Family&#x27;s filled the streets.  Kids played tag on the pavilion.  The festival was in full force, even on the same block where the shooting happened.

               [figure highland-park-scene-2]

               [figure highland-park-scene-3]

               My duties at these art shows consist of the following: sit with Marissa, swipe credit cards on her square app, and curate a local selection of foods.  This weekend, we were blessed by the greasy, crispy, burnt-cheesy experience of Lefty&#x27;s pizza.

               [figure leftys-pizza]

               One morning, I filed in a line out the door of &quot;That Little French Guy&quot; pastry shop.  They had a sign on the wall that read food is universal, pastry is French (in French of course).  I think when it comes to pastries, a little bit of arrogance is a good sign that you made the right choice.

               [figure pastries]

               We had good weather up until the last minute of the show - and I mean the last minute.  In a turn of awful luck, a vigorous summer downpour started up immediately after we took down the tent.  Marissa and I scrambled to get the paintings in the back of the truck.  Marissa, after hitting the bony part of her shin on the metal door, yelled in my ear, &quot;I&#x27;m not doing any more outdoor shows.  I&#x27;m an artist - not a friggen&#x27; dock worker.&quot;

               Inching through traffic while rain clapped against the windshield, we discussed the trade-offs of outdoor shows.  Setting up a bulky metal tent, sitting in the sun for hours, and inevitably losing some paintings whenever it rained - was it worth it?

               We packed up the family and made one evening last trip to drop off the u-haul.  We pulled into Nana&#x27;s and ordered a round of shakes, hotdogs, and italian beefs just a few minutes before they closed.  It was a fitting reward for the hectic load out, and a high point in the weekend.

               [figure nanas]

               I&#x27;ll leave you with a napkin drawing before I go.  We&#x27;ve been watching a lot of TV lately while recovering from COVID on the couch, and I guess I have TV on the brain.

               [figure better-call-rodney-napkin]

               Thanks for stopping by.  Have a great Thursday.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, friends.  It&#x27;s Wednesday today, but I think it&#x27;s never too early (or too late) to think about the weekend.  Grab your coffee and get in here, it&#x27;s time for a belated weekend in pictures.

               We&#x27;re getting to know our cul-de-sac neighbors John and Kathy better.  Things must be going well, because they promoted us to homegrown cucumbers tier.  Do you remember the first time you learned that cucumbers and pickles were the same vegetable?  John and Kathy&#x27;s cucumbers actually look like pickles, so it&#x27;s easier to wrap my head around that fun fact while snacking on these at night.  Also, each time I snack on cucumbers, Marissa reminds me of the time early in our marriage where I scolded her in an unbecoming way for putting salt on cucumber slices.  &quot;Only a psychopath would put salt on a fresh cucumber,&quot; I reply with unflinching honesty.

               [figure cucumbers]

               When you move, certain areas of the new place inevitably turn into &quot;junk rooms&quot; - and hopefully that&#x27;s a temporary arrangement.  Sometimes you just need to save some unpacking for another time and get on with sprucing up the areas of you house you spend more time in.  Our garage became one of these places.  I avoided going in there because of the pang of guilt I felt for leaving such a beautiful garage in turmoil.  The only reason I&#x27;m going to show you a picture of the garage in this state is because we cleaned it over the weekend, and now I&#x27;m so proud of it I find any excuse to walk through it.

               [figure before]

               Moving a pile of scrap wood, we discovered a brave band of crickets.  We never used to get crickets in our yard in Madison, and the boys were fascinated.  Miles tormented the same cricket for a half hour.  He affectionately pinched him off the ground and screamed every time the cricket tried to jump to freedom.  That cricket had a strange day.

               [figure cricket]

               Rodney helped me move our boxes of Christmas decorations to the attic.  Rodney had his hesitations about climbing into the unexplored, dark, humid lair, but he couldn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to try out his learned ninja gymnastic skills on the tall metal ladder.  Dad knows best - never pass up the opportunity to hang out in the attic.  It&#x27;s cool up there.

               [figure attic]

               At last, my server rack is back.  It lives in our laundry room, and surrounded by all the other whirring machines and loud ventilation, it feels right at home.  I cracked a smile at the realization that I can buy noisier components now that this hunk of metal is no longer running in our bedroom.

               [figure debian]

               Minnie has just about decided on her college major, but she would be open to an internship in IT as sort of a stepping stone.  A resume with a little variety never hurts.

               [figure intern]

               I&#x27;ve wondered how the rest of my family feels now that we&#x27;ve permanently moved to their Dad&#x27;s hometown.  Schaumburg is not a big place, and our normal errands often take us past my childhood house and other places from my past.  Last week, we went out of the way to hang out a place my sisters and I called &quot;castle park&quot;.  &quot;The playground used to be made out of wood, and it was painted to look like a red castle,&quot; I explained.  All that&#x27;s been torn down and replaced with shiny, round metal.  We each took a seat on a swing.  We held a contest to see who could throw their shoes the furthest.  The loser had to run into dairy queen and pick us up some icecream.

               [figure castle-park]

               &quot;Is it just me, or is the sky more interesting to look at here?&quot; I asked, rocking gently on the swing.  &quot;It feels like the clouds do more interesting things in Illinois.&quot;

               [figure sky]

               &quot;Take a look at my sword,&quot; said Rodney.  We stepped outside for a photo shoot - no questions asked.  No smiles, of course.  Just the stoic gaze of a k&#x27;nex warrior-inventor.

               [figure sword]

               We ate dinner at the hotly mentioned Kuma&#x27;s, and we were not impressed.  They&#x27;ve won so many awards that I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll even notice my bad press.  The famous Kuma&#x27;s burger was impressive, but only as much as you can be impressed by a the overplayed &quot;big ass burger&quot; theme.  I feel like I&#x27;ve eaten this same meal hundreds of times in Madison.

               [figure kumas]

               Kuma&#x27;s reminded us of the burger place we tried in Brookfield.  It had the same loud death metal music, tatted up serving staff, and anarcho-satanic-biker dining room feel.  Marissa found a pentagram on the wall and reprised our favorite inside joke from that visit: &quot;Look kids, it&#x27;s the devil.&quot;

               Another vigorous summer rain passed through, and that was unlucky for us because we were eating outside.  Really, it was just unlucky for Miles - we were under the tent, but his high chair sat directly beneath the downspout of cold rain water.

               [figure rain]

               &quot;Do you get it?&quot; asked Marissa.  &quot;I heard it on Facebook.&quot;

               &quot;I could tell,&quot; I said, raising my eyebrows.  I would not dignify this joke with a laugh, but I suppose it can join the napkin wall.

               [figure tender-napkin]

               That&#x27;s a weekend.  Thanks for stopping by, and have a great Wednesday.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Happy Tuesday, and as always, grab a cup of coffee and make yourself comfortable.

               Sip.  Heading to bed last Sunday, I felt a glimmer of excitement around writing a journal entry on Monday.  We cleaned our garage, swam in our neighbord&#x27;s pool, and got caught in the rain at a sub-par burger restaurant.  There would be plenty to write about.  I lowered the shades and slid into the covers.  I was minutes from sailing off to sleep.  Then I heard a pleading voice from the dining room.

               &quot;Hon, something&#x27;s wrong,&quot; said Marissa.  &quot;I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s breathing.&quot;

               You may have noticed we&#x27;ve been a little quiet about Ducky lately.  The big move from Wisconsin was hard on her, but she survived.  We had some trouble finding a place in this house that was warm enough for her terrarium.  But she seemed to be getting better.  She wasn&#x27;t spending much time outside her hide, but I had gotten her to nibble on a few meal worms.  We assured ourselves that she was still just getting used to the new place, and that was fine.

               We grew more concerned with her heading into this past weekend.  &quot;I&#x27;m worried about her,&quot; I admitted.  &quot;I don&#x27;t want her to die.&quot;  Marissa winced, hearing the &quot;d&quot; word, and even I felt like I was being overly dramatic.  Out of desperation, I returned from the nearest pets mart with a new sampling of heat lamps.  I left a bowl of chubby, slow moving wax worms at the mouth of her cave.  I used one of our old baking pans to give her a warm bath.

               &quot;We&#x27;ll take her to the vet on Monday,&quot; said Marissa in soothing assurance.

               When I joined Marissa in the dining room on Sunday night, I refused to believe that Ducky had passed.  &quot;She&#x27;s cold-blooded, and we can&#x27;t be sure she&#x27;s dead,&quot; I said.  Despite my suggestion being steeped in bullshit and denial, we went with my plan.  We would leave her in her warm cave until the morning.

               We went to bed, but we didn&#x27;t even bother turning the light off.  Marissa and I sat awake, silently panic-googling on our phones.  If Ducky was dead, we had a narrow window of time to get her to a vet for a necropsy.  She needed to be moved to the fridge.

               &quot;I&#x27;ll do it,&quot; I gulped.  I left the bedroom, but I didn&#x27;t return.  I don&#x27;t know how long I stayed up with Ducky, but all at once it dawned on me what putting her body in the fridge meant.  UV bulbs, heat lamps, warming pads, all her life our job was to keep her warm.  Putting Ducky in the fridge, symbolically, was an admission that she was gone.  It was the point of no return.

               I stayed up with Ducky, crying harder than I&#x27;ve cried in a while.  To give you an idea of how hard I cried, I had to use the same one-handed scoop-and-swipe maneuver on myself that I use to collect Miles&#x27; drool and boogers.  I was a mess.  Even though she had stopped breathing and started to grow cold, she felt so fragile in my hands.  I wanted her to kick, bite, blink, and do something small to tell me she was still with us.  It took me forever, but I wrapped her in paper towels.  I plucked some flower petals from the vase on our dining room kitchen and made a bed.  I cried for another twenty minutes in front of the fridge, ignoring the little alarm that sounds when we leave the fridge door open.

               Marissa suggested that she had something wrong with her developing eggs.  She read some facts about what it meant when lizards were &quot;egg bound&quot;.  &quot;It kind of matches her symptoms,&quot; she said sniffing back her own tears.

               We looked up her birthday.  Marissa remembered the date was stamped on the deli cup, and we had plenty of pictures.  To my horror, the black lettering on the sticker in the photo clearly read 8/22/2021.  &quot;It was her birthday,&quot; Marissa whimpered - and so began thirty more minutes of bitter sobbing.

               She was too young to be egg bound.  I must have been something about her environment - something we missed.  I barely slept, waking up between nightmares, haunted by the image of our sweet little ducky fighting for her life while I drank beer and ate snacks on the couch in the next room.

               We told Rodney the next morning.  Hearing the news at the breakfast table, he stared off at her empty cage and made a frown.  After a few lingering seconds of silence, he looked down at Minnie.  &quot;At least we have Minnie,&quot; he shrugged.  With that final thought, he carefully picked a brown peanut butter flavored nugget out of his cereal and lowered it down to Minnie.  He jogged off to meet the bus like it was a regular day.

               I began calling around for vets.  I had a hard time finding a place that offered care to geckos.  One place nearby offered to do a gross necropy.  &quot;So you can do it, but it just... it won&#x27;t be very detailed,&quot; said the friendly voice.  &quot;I... would find some place else.&quot;

               She recommended an exotics vet in Lisle only twenty minutes away.  Maybe I was too grief stricken, but in hindsight it was kind of amazing at how crass the nurse assistant was to me on the phone.

               &quot;We have a policy,&quot; she droned.  &quot;Necropsies are only for existing patients.  If he was a patient of ours, we could do it.&quot;  She didn&#x27;t even bother to learn Ducky was a girl, and that rubbed me the wrong way.

               &quot;Can you recommend me somewhere that doesn&#x27;t have this policy,&quot; I asked.  &quot;We just moved here, and we weren&#x27;t set up with an vet...&quot;

               &quot;U of I,&quot; she stated.

               &quot;U of I?&quot; I repeated.  &quot;Like... the one in Champagne?&quot;

               &quot;University of Illinois,&quot; she said curtly.  &quot;I don&#x27;t know where it is, I just know that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m told to send people.&quot;

               I wasn&#x27;t driving to Champagne on a Monday morning with a dead gecko.  But luckily, Chicago Exotics in Skokie was a hundred times more accommodating.  &quot;What was your pets name?&quot; asked the nurse.

               &quot;Her name was Ducky,&quot; I cracked.

               The nurse explained the vet could perform the necropsy, handle her remains, and email me a post mortem report by the end of the day.  &quot;And, I&#x27;m sorry for your loss, I&#x27;m sure Ducky was special - they&#x27;re never around for long enough, are they?&quot;  Sputtering through a new wave of tears, I spelled out my address and email while the nurse patiently waited.

               Grief is hard work.  The emotions, the thoughts, and all the processing left me exhausted.  I was tempted to stifle my emotions.  After all, she was just a lizard, and we only had her for a year.  Was I overdoing it?  But you shouldn&#x27;t stifle the grieving process either.  You shouldn&#x27;t put parameters around how long it takes - at least that&#x27;s what the WikiHow article titled How to Process Grief said.

               As tempting as it was to stifle the grief and move on, I&#x27;m glad I kept working through it.  I contemplated why I felt such guilt over her death.  I took a quiet moment to study the intrusive thoughts that had been rolling around in my head all day.

               &quot;I was her caretaker, and she died too young.  It was my fault.  I didn&#x27;t keep her warm.  I didn&#x27;t give her the right vitamins.  I didn&#x27;t feed her food that was small enough.  I didn&#x27;t deserve her.  I didn&#x27;t really put the work in.  I&#x27;m too lazy for a pet like her.  She would have had a better life with someone else.  While I was posting pictures of her on Instagram, she was probably cold, hungry, or in pain.  She probably hated me.&quot;

               The more I spelled out these thoughts, the easier it was to see where the guilt was coming from.  So what if I made a mistake?  This was our first gecko, and we did the best we could.  Even to the bitter end, we managed to get her body to an exotic vet in Skokie in an eighteen hour window so we could learn from it.  Even if the vet found it was something basic and avoidable that killed her, he had to respect the effort to become better pet owners.  And why was I so afraid of feeling judged?  No matter how many people reached out with supportive, kind words on Facebook and Instagram, I was hell-bent on believing that everyone was judging me for letting my gecko die.  Even if it was my mistake, nobody has the right to judge me for it.  She was my pet, and the sense of loss and sadness I felt was bad enough without this imaginary cloud of judgment hanging over my head.

               Don&#x27;t stifle guilt, no matter how small the loss.  Yesterday, I realized the wisdom in that advice.  If I had pushed Ducky back in my thoughts, I would have missed all this other stuff.  The plain, boring truth was that Ducky was a lizard.  She didn&#x27;t resent me or carry her own hot takes over how good of a caretaker I was.  Those were just my own feelings of guilt and fear taking the form of a lizard.  I&#x27;m deeply insecure about how people perceive me, and too often I let these thoughts invade the things that bring me joy.  I have an unhealthy perspective over my own mistakes.  When it comes to learning new things, I treat my own outcomes like failure unless I immediately figure things out on the first try.

               Marissa took an opposite seat on the couch next to me.  We shared a weird moment where, unprompted, she said something that captured my thoughts perfectly.  &quot;Now that I worked through everything, I just miss her.  That&#x27;s it.&quot;

               Ducky was a happy little lizard.  She brought me joy.  I miss her.  That&#x27;s it.

               My phone chirped with a new email.  The vet wrote a concise, somber paragraph describing the cysts and legions he found around her eggs.  He was surprised that such a young age, Ducky was already fully sexually mature.  The quick transformation may have led to some problems, like fat deposits on her liver.

               It wasn&#x27;t my fault, but thankfully I already came to that conclusion.  But still, it felt like the email from the vet gave me permission to feel proud of how well we took care of her.  &quot;She had an amazing tank,&quot; reminded Marissa.  &quot;How many geckos get to watch the sun rise every morning?&quot;

               That was true.  Ducky&#x27;s enclosure was massive.  Every time I walked in the room, she was exploring a new spot.

               [figure climbing]

               Ducky was adventurous.  She explored every inch of her enclosure, sometimes leaving a solitary little gecko poop like a flag on new conquered territory.

               [figure my-plant]

               She loved to eat bugs.  She lived knowing the taste of butter worms, meal worms, horn worms, dubias, and red runners.

               [video eating]

               Ducky&#x27;s enclosure was by our bedroom window.  Early in the morning before I&#x27;d let the dogs out, I peeked open her curtain so she could watch the sun rise on our street.  Not fake sunlight from a light bulb - real sunshine.  It scattered off the snow on the street and sparkled like diamonds.  Sometimes it made her tank look like Heaven.

               [figure moist-cave]

               We used to stay up way too late with Ducky.  While all the other kids and animals in the house were quietly sleeping, we invited Ducky into the inner circle of late night hangouts.  Most of the time, Marissa just held her in her hand while she wrote in her planner, but sometimes there were drinks and snacks all around.

               [figure planner]

               It was hard to go to bed once Ducky joined the party.  The three of us were like a secret nocturnal friendship.

               [figure late]

               Ducky may have only been with us for a year, but now that I&#x27;m scrolling through her photos and videos, finally letting tears fall freely on my keyboard, it&#x27;s easy to see she was the happiest lizard in the world.

               &quot;Did you know that today was Ducky&#x27;s birthday?&quot; said Rodney at the dinner table.  &quot;Dad said she gets to have her birthday in heaven.&quot;

               Marissa cracked a smile.  &quot;What do you think she got for her birthday?&quot; she asked.

               &quot;Swimming pool... filled with worms,&quot; laughed Rodney.

               &quot;And she&#x27;s just housing them,&quot; laughed Marissa.

               &quot;I think that even though she&#x27;s in heaven, she still has a window that looks down over Union street,&quot; I said.  Cue yet another twenty minutes of crying.

               Goodbye, Ducky.  I&#x27;m going to miss you so much.  Your enclosure, wiped clean and packed away, looks so empty without you.  I&#x27;m sorry you had to go so soon, but I hope you enjoyed the ride as much as we did.  There&#x27;s not going to be another Ducky.  Rest easy knowing that you are the one and only mighty Duckasaur.  Feared by roaches, climber of rocks, watcher of sunrises, and smiling late night friend.  I hope you had a wonderful birthday party in gecko heaven.  I&#x27;ll miss you, and I&#x27;ll never forget you.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  How are you feeling today?

               This morning, I&#x27;m set up to blog from my corner office (the corner of Marissa&#x27;s art studio, that is).  Being the same environment where I slog through my typical workday, I&#x27;m a little surprised at how cozy and relaxing it feels this morning.  Is it the nice weather?  Is it an effect of being surrounded by so much soothing contemporary art?  Let&#x27;s be honest, I think it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s Friday.

               Sip.  I wanted to get at least one entry in before the weekend, but you may have noticed I took a bit of a hiatus from writing.  You haven&#x27;t missed much.  It&#x27;s been a heads-down kind of week, and even though Rodney is the only member of the family actually returning to school, we&#x27;ve all shared the same &quot;back to school&quot; attitude.  Marissa and I are back to flossing (BAM - blood everywhere).  We&#x27;ve instituted nightly cleaning parties to get the boys used to this radical new idea of picking up after themselves.  We&#x27;re building a new daily routine.

               Rodney relishes in a wardrobe renaissance.  Each night, he sifts through a stack of new t-shirts - all of them he personally approved, and all of them feature some kind of dinosaur.  When he finds the perfect combination, he lays them out on his floor like he&#x27;s dressing an invisible boy.

               [figure clothes]

               It&#x27;s only the first week of school, but I can already tell that all this new energy we&#x27;re feeling might get diverted into side projects that fell by the wayside during the move.  One night this week, I grabbed a screwdriver and trudged down into the basement.  I found my defunct, forsaken server rack in the back corner of the laundry room.  I got to work.  Nothing too heavy - I just took apart the server I fried and separated the parts into piles.  Twisting velcro ties around the unkempt cables felt like a silent therapy, like I was bringing order to chaos.

               [figure server]

               Marissa got back to painting dinosaurs on Rodney&#x27;s wall.  Since you&#x27;ve probably last seen it, she&#x27;s added a smirking long-neck dinosaur.  She quickly outlined and painted the shape, but took at least a full day to mull over the color.

               &quot;Does this color look weird?&quot; she said.  &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I like it.&quot;

               &quot;No,&quot; I shrugged.  &quot;It looks fine to me.&quot;

               &quot;Just curious,&quot; she smiled.  &quot;What color would I have to pick for you to think it looked weird?  Hot pink?  Neon yellow?&quot;

               &quot;Colors never look weird to me,&quot; I said.  &quot;It looks like a dinosaur, the color is just, like, a reference point, right?&quot;

               &quot;I think I&#x27;ll just make it grey instead,&quot; she said softly to herself.

               [figure dinosaur]

               How about a napkin drawing - for the road?

               [figure dinosaur-napkin]

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Have a great weekend, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Happy Tuesday.  Pull up a chair and make yourself comfortable.  If it&#x27;s too early in the morning for metaphors, just squint at the screen in front of you.

               Did you bring your coffee today?  Nice - we&#x27;re gonna need that.

               Sip.  Happy second day of school, reader.  The &quot;second day of school&quot; doesn&#x27;t have as much of a ring to it, but that same back to school energy sustains me this week.  Last night, Marissa and I had no choice but to stay up late to finish the Better Call Saul series finale.  Sleep was in short supply, but every sip I draw from this mug of coffee makes me feel a little more alive.

               Today, I&#x27;m in search of a do-over for yesterday.  By a lot of measures, it was a crappy day.  Yesterday was supposed to be Krang&#x27;s big comeback.  Between shivering in the back of the fridge, surviving a cross state move, and living off of a measly weekly meal, Krang the sourdough starter had a rough summer.  I was eager to break out the bread station and finally bring the smell of fresh bread into the house.

               &quot;I miss stukjes,&quot; said Marissa.  She stared off into space, thinking about the last time we shared a butt end sample of a loaf of bread with coffee.

               One of the worst parts of moving has been getting used to a new kitchen.  I misjudged the height of the top rack of our new oven, and yesterday the first Krang loaf paid the price for my miscalculation.  The loaf of bread sprung upward out of the pan, flushly meeting the top of my oven.  Grey smoke trickled into the kitchen.  I had to use a spatula to pry the blackened bread free.  Burnt bread - bummer.

               But we still haven&#x27;t even covered the biggest fiasco of the day.  Rodney&#x27;s school let out.  Marissa led Minnie across the street to Rodney&#x27;s bus stop.  I anxiously stood in the living room.  The bus sluggishly turned onto our street.  I had the camera ready when it coasted to a stop.  Marissa disappeared behind the automatic door.  After a few minutes, my phone buzzed.

               &quot;Rodney&#x27;s not on the bus,&quot; she wrote.  &quot;They&#x27;re trying to figure it out.&quot;

               The bus driver couldn&#x27;t confirm that Rodney even boarded his bus.  The school couldn&#x27;t tell us which bus they sent him on.  The transportation company couldn&#x27;t figure out which bus he wrongly boarded.  We spent the next forty-five minutes calling the office, driving around the neighborhood, and waiting.

               At last, an empty bus coasted up to our curb, and Rodney climbed down the steps.  Thankfully, he didn&#x27;t share the panic and dread Marissa and I felt.  &quot;They put me on the wrong bus,&quot; he laughed, shrugging off the whole ordeal like a funny joke.  The driver explained that the school put him on the wrong bus.  The school told us the drivers would take attendance for the first week, but the driver said those instructions never got relayed down to the rest of the drivers.  On top of everything, her radio was broken, so she couldn&#x27;t tell dispatch where Rodney was.  &quot;I just had to use my personal phone to call them, which technically you&#x27;re not supposed to do,&quot; said the driver apologetically.  &quot;I wasn&#x27;t going to let him off the bus - your kids are always safe with us.&quot;

               I suppose the driver did the right thing.  Driving my son around in the wrong bus is a lot less serious than letting him off at the wrong stop.  I don&#x27;t want to overreact, but I still feel angry about the whole ordeal.  It&#x27;s only the second day of school, and I already know way more about how the school delegates transportation than I ever wanted to know.

               &quot;What&#x27;s your bus number?&quot; I quizzed Rodney in bed.

               &quot;One-oh... fart,&quot; he replied.  My scowl told him I was not in a joking mood.  &quot;One-oh-seven&quot;, he corrected.

               We taught him one more line before we sent him out the door this morning.  Hi, would you please look at my ticket and tell me if I&#x27;m on the right bus?

               Let&#x27;s end the entry on a fun note, shall we?  Rodney asked for an elaborate napkin design: a night playing video games in space.  Where does he get off asking for such an elaborate napkin drawing on the second day of school?  Still, we don&#x27;t shy away from a challenge in this house.

               [figure knight-video-games-space-napkin]

               Have a great Tuesday, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Happy Monday.

               I think it&#x27;s going to be a picture kind of entry today, as I needed extra time this morning to shepherd my first grader off to school.  OK, really that part barely took longer than five seconds.  After all, Rodney just had to walk to the bottom of the driveway.

               [figure walk]

               The found a spot on the corner, then seeing the bus stopped down the street, they second guessed themselves.  They ran up the block, then doubled-back to their original spot.  I chuckled from my vantage point in the front window.  We&#x27;re all kind of new to this school bus thing.

               The bus whizzed out of view, and in an instant Rodney was gone.  Marissa trudged back up the driveway.  Marissa says that Rodney climbed into the bus at an instant.  He probably wanted to fulfill his lifelong dream of being a bus commuter before we had a chance to change our minds.  He nonchalantly waved back from his window seat as it pulled out onto the road.

               Sip.  Emotions are running high this weekend - the nice kind.  It feels like the school year came upon us so quickly.  We toured the school last Friday afternoon.  After we dropped off Rodney&#x27;s supplies and met his teacher, we walked around the building.  The hallways felt bright and cheery.  The crisp, conditioned air felt like a luxurious refuge from the summer heat.  In the pictures I snapped of our family wandering around, we all have the same doughy-eyed, slack jawed expression on our faces.

               [figure tour]

               Our excitement rubbed off on Rodney like a static charge.  On Saturday, he spent thirty minutes obsessively laying out each article of clothing from his batch of new school clothes.

               [figure clothes]

               Marissa, part time barber, set up shop in the bathroom.  Rodney stopped in to clean up his moppy summer mane.

               [figure haircut]

               Guess what&#x27;s back?  That&#x27;s right - it&#x27;s time to break out the napkin drawings.  Today, a knight in armor leads a peanut butter and jelly, a bag of pirates booty, an orange, and three chocolate covered pretzels into battle.

               If I&#x27;m being honest, I envy Rodney.  I used to love the first day of school.  Unworn clothes, unwrinkled folders, and unsharpened pencils set the stage for a fresh start.  For the rest of us, it&#x27;s just another Monday in August, but for Rodney he&#x27;s entering into another world.

               &quot;You should make a letter board for Miles that says first day of absolutely nothing,&quot; I laughed.

               &quot;First day of... still being a baby,&quot; she echoed sleepily.

               How will Miles adjust to Rodney&#x27;s new day job?  He&#x27;ll either adore the concentrated attention, or he&#x27;ll hate it - nothing in between.

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Happy first day of school, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning - readers of words, clock punchers, and people silently and contently staring at their phone screens.  I&#x27;m sending you good vibes on this Thursday morning.

               Our living room shades hang closed, sealing in a comfortable pillow of darkness around where I write.  This morning, I feel like leaving the room as dark as this cup of coffee... which reminds me, I have yet to take a sip of coffee this morning.

               Sip.  How has the week been for you?  I had an action-packed Wednesday, which began with opening up a new spider in the mail.  I caught the Fed-Ex driver on the porch just as he was leaving that little &quot;we tried to deliver&quot; sticky note on my door.  I sliced open the box, unspooled the film canister free from a wet napkin cocoon.  I grabbed our biggest mixing bowl from the sink and began the monotonous chore of breaking up a brick of cocoa fiber with my fingers.

               Our choice creature substrate is cocoa fiber.  It&#x27;s cheap and widely available.  You can order it to your door from dozens on vendors on Amazon, and it arrives tightly pressed in bricks sealed in plastic wrap.  The only drawback of cocoa fiber is that it can be a little time consuming to turn it into something that resembles normal dirt.

               I didn&#x27;t make this tenth enclosure in my collection very fancy.  Using a fist, I packed the dirt into the lower half of the plastic cube.  I poked a plastic water bowl in the corner.  I used my index finger to dig the beginnings of a burrow into the corner.  At last - time to release the beast.

               [figure new-spider]

               Beans is a Brazilian White-Knee tarantula.  Full grown, he might achieve a legspan of eight inches, and his species is known to grow pretty quickly.  He&#x27;ll be moving out of this box soon, so why even bother with fake plants or cork bork?

               Yesterday was Ziggy&#x27;s birthday, and I&#x27;ve already spent too much time talking about the other animals in the house.  By her account, her birthday was an absolute disaster.  First, Marissa set the smoke alarm off while searing a beautiful piece of salmon on the cast iron skillet - and Ziggy hates smoke.  As soon as she heard the alarm, she grabbed up her new birthday toys and fled into the bedroom.  Then she and mom got in an argument while practicing agility in the backyard.

               [figure princess]

               Did she get the fifth birthday she deserved?  We weren&#x27;t sure, so just to hedge our bets, we gave her a little bowl of goldfish crackers and some pretzel sticks.

               After dinner, I jumped in the car and drove to Wheaton.  I would be sharing a beer with an old friend.  Jordan, while briefly visiting the states away from his permanent home in Japan, tracked me down on Facebook and asked if I wanted to reconnect.  I found him in the back corner of the noisy bar sitting underneath a speaker thumping with country music.

               &quot;I have to come clean - this was not the place I thought I was picking,&quot; I laughed after we had moved outside.  My real choice was a low key Irish pub restaurant in downtown Wheaton, but carelessly running with the first Irish bar in the Google results, we ended up at this ruddy dive bar that was at least a five minute drive from the rest of the town.

               &quot;I barely remember anything from CLA,&quot; he laughed.  &quot;Except hanging out with you in seventh grade.  We were constantly hanging out.&quot;

               Jordan jogged my memory.  In seventh grade, we were inseparable, and the pillars of our friendship were quoting Strongbad emails and avoiding talking to the girls in our class.  Jordan finished high school going the home school route, and after a few on-and-off years seeing each other around church, we parted ways.  Jordan would go on to move to Japan, meet his wife, and take a job teaching English.  I came across an episode of his podcast he shared on Facebook.

               &quot;I can&#x27;t believe you listened to that,&quot; he chuckled.

               &quot;I just put it on while washing dishes one night,&quot; I replied.  &quot;I couldn&#x27;t tell you what you were talking about, but it sounded like you were really getting into it.&quot;

               &quot;We were mostly just testing the equipment,&quot; he added.  &quot;My buddy wanted to keep going, but... I lose interest in things unless I have a really clear vision for where it&#x27;s heading.&quot;

               A decade plus a few years later, Jordan and I have little left in common now.  But I&#x27;ve learned that when you have the chance to reconnect with someone from your past, it&#x27;s best to take it.  In re-learning about someone, you often rediscover what made you friends in the first place.  His decisions felt relatable.  His interests felt familiar.  Our choices took us in different directions, but the common threads still ran between us.

               We got on the subject of creative writing - a shared interest of ours.  &quot;I heard a quote you would like,&quot; said Jordan.  &quot;Every person is a great writer - they just have to write a million words worth of bad literature first before they get to the good stuff.&quot;  Needless to say, as a blogger, that sage wisdom resonated with me.

               &quot;HAWKS WIN,&quot; belched a bar patron who stepped outside for a smoke.  With a burning cigarette hanging on his lip, he leaned in for a closer look at my t-shirt.  &quot;HAWKS WIN - HAWKS WIN - I&#x27;m a huge hawks fan.&quot;

               Jordan and I shifted uncomfortably in our seats, but oblivious to our cues, the stranger continued to ramble.

               &quot;Huge hawks fan... bears fan... cubs fan... I have a cubs tattoo.&quot;  He turned his leg, presenting a faded tattoo on his calf muscle.

               Minutes passed as the guy continued to drunkenly ramble from the flank of our table.  Somehow, he got on the subject of his own high school football legacy.  He boasted of his own prowess as a defensive corner back.  &quot;It&#x27;s my long arms,&quot; he said waggling his eye brows.  &quot;Look, they&#x27;re even longer than yours.&quot;  He sidled up to the table and held his arm against Jordan&#x27;s.

               &quot;You know... I haven&#x27;t seen my friend here in a while, and I&#x27;m leaving the states pretty soon,&quot; said Jordan, easing into the uncomfortable moment.  &quot;We are kind of in the middle of something.&quot;

               &quot;I&#x27;ll fuck off,&quot; said the smoker.  He put up his arms and took three steps backwards.  &quot;I&#x27;ll finish this cig over here, and I&#x27;ll go back inside - no worries brother.&quot;

               Jordan and I parted ways.  But before he jumped in his car, I asked to take a picture.

               &quot;You... want to take it in the dark?&quot; he said hesitantly.

               &quot;You&#x27;re right, let&#x27;s take it on the porch where there&#x27;s a light,&quot; I suggested.

               Sure, the eerie green light looks like we were caught on a deer cam in the woods, but we had a great chat.  &quot;Look me up next time your in the states,&quot; I said.  &quot;You, me, and our new friend can play football or something.&quot;

               Thanks for stopping by today.  Have a great Thursday, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, friends.  Happy Wednesday morning.  How are you feeling today?  I&#x27;m feeling pretty good myself, thank you.  Maybe it&#x27;s the cooler weather we&#x27;ve had this week.  Or possibly getting my first haircut since we moved has me feeling put together and well-groomed for a change.  Or maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been sitting at the computer for ten minutes, and so far I haven&#x27;t had to get up to talk to a village inspector.

               Why question a good morning?  Instead of trying to get to the bottom of these good vibes, let&#x27;s just keep sipping coffee and go with the flow.

               Sip.  Yeah, how about that inspector that rang our doorbell at 8:30 in the morning the other day?  That made for a weird morning.  But I have to admit, once I just resigned to pushing the rest of my day back by about twenty minutes, I got caught up in the excitement of problem solving.

               &quot;Whether that&#x27;s a down-spout or from the sump&#x27;, those aren&#x27;t suppose to extend more than ten feet from the property,&quot; she said.  &quot;Technically, that&#x27;s...&quot;

               &quot;Illegal?&quot; I suggested.

               The inspector pursed her lips and nodded.  &quot;We don&#x27;t want property owners dumping rain water into their neighbors&#x27; yards,&quot; she continued.  &quot;That&#x27;s the spirit of the law.  The right thing to do is to distribute it around the land you own.&quot;

               &quot;Well, this is an old house... maybe they put this in back in the sixties or something before there were good laws for that kind of thing...&quot;

               The inspector shook her head before I even finished my sentence.  &quot;The plastic tubing doesn&#x27;t last very long,&quot; she hinted.  &quot;It had to have been in the last five years or so.&quot;

               So what began with a mysterious wet spot in the yard ended up being an illegal, underground drain.  Before leaving, she assured me that it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem unless neighbors started to complain.  I followed her back up our driveway and thanked her for her time.

               &quot;Oh, and you should probably clean out your gutter, that&#x27;s probably why this one is leaking out of the middle,&quot; she said.

               &quot;Nope,&quot; I smirked.  &quot;That was my fault.  I clipped it while backing out a U-haul - I&#x27;m on top of it.&quot;  I have to admit, after patiently listening to the inspector lecture me about my house&#x27;s run-off water for the previous twenty minutes, it felt good to correct her on something.

               After all the fun we had last weekend swimming, mini-golfing, and galavanting around the zoo, it&#x27;s been a heads down kind of week.  I&#x27;ve been tethered to my office chair, leaving the room for lunch, water breaks, and walks with Ziggy.  Marissa has been hard at work shlepping the rest of the rocks out of the pit.  It&#x27;s still a pit, but by the sweat of her brow, now it&#x27;s strictly a dirt and sand pit.

               [figure pit]

               We hired some people to finish the job - they&#x27;ll bring in some equipment to bust of the concrete supports and finally cover the area with grass.  Then what will we do?  I bet Marissa will celebrate the summer-long pool removal project by taking a nap in the fresh new patch of grass.  &quot;Maybe we&#x27;ll set out an inflatable pool there,&quot; she laughed.

               Meanwhile, Miles and Rodney have been so rambunctious, I think we&#x27;re more excited for the beginning of the school year than they are.  In fact, I&#x27;m so tired from 24/7 summer Rodney that I found myself doing something I thought I&#x27;d never do - taunting him about the final days of his waning summer.

               &quot;You know what today is, dude?&quot; I asked from across the lunch table.  Rodney perked up.  &quot;It&#x27;s the last Tuesday of the summer,&quot; I teased.  &quot;And tomorrow is the last Wednesday of the summer.  I wonder if you&#x27;ll have homework to do next week.&quot;

               Rodney seemed un-phased by my teasing.  School or no-school, homework or not, it makes no difference to his action-packed life.

               Before I go, I should remind you all that it&#x27;s Ziggy&#x27;s birthday today.  If you see her, please treat her like a princess (as if that&#x27;s not what we already do every day).

               [figure babygirl]

               Thanks for stopping by, friends.  Have a great Wednesday.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Did you look outside your window today?  It&#x27;s raining.  Dark and drizzly with the occasional exciting flash of white lightning across the sky.  This is the kind of weather you take a nap in - how cruel that this is how we have to begin our Monday morning.

               No naps for the weary.  Grab your coffee and let&#x27;s roll, reader.

               Sip.  I sat down to write about a half hour ago.  But from the corner of my eye I saw a stranger pace up my driveway and politely ring the doorbell.  The dogs went ape-shit, and as I used my leg like a shepherd&#x27;s crook to herd them back into the bedroom, I quietly decided to not only refuse what this lady was selling, but also give her a piece of my mind for trying it at 8:30 in the morning.

               &quot;I&#x27;m with the village, I&#x27;m here to speak with Marissa about the permits for a dry well.&quot;

               Oh - well nevermind.  So instead of writing, I joined the inspector outside in the backyard.  Un-phased by the rain drops splashing our faces, she schooled me on village codes, soil composition, and water flow.  But we&#x27;ll have to catch up on all of that later.  We had a busy weekend - possibly the world&#x27;s busiest weekend - and I have a lot to tell you about.

               &quot;You know we only have two more weekends before Rodney starts school,&quot; said Marissa to me.  It feels like we just got here, and our summer is already slipping away.  So either intentionally or subconsciously, our family has been packing as many summer activities as possible into our few remaining weekends.

               On Friday, Marissa and I hired Anthony and Julia to hang out with the boys while we hit the town.  We shared margaritas at our favorite restaurant and we hit eighteen holes of mini golf.

               [figure golfing]

               We spent the whole day at the zoo, taking in everything.  We wandered the murky blue depths of the ocean exhibit.  We braved chattering monkeys.  We made kissing noises to draw the attention of a pack of African Painted dogs.  Rodney challenged the personal space bubble of an aloof peacock.

               [figure peacock]

               Miles fell in love with our five dollar bag of popcorn, and he grew tired of sharing with us.  We gave in to his demands, so for most of the afternoon Miles tottled behind us clutching his prize.  He left a zig-zagging path of kernels and crumbs behind him.

               [figure popcorn]

               It was getting dark out, and our tired family stood at a crossroads.  Would be stay for one carousel ride, or head straight to the parking lot?  The vote wasn&#x27;t even close.

               [figure carousel]

               &quot;This is for the kids, they want this,&quot; I thought.  &quot;I know I&#x27;m hungry, but I can get through one carousel ride.&quot;

               &quot;You were making your this is my personal hell face,&quot; teased Marissa.

               [figure face]

               The wait was worth it.  Shortly after, we&#x27;d me scarfing down burgers at a pub in downtown Brookfield.

               [figure burgers]

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Here&#x27;s to the last few weekends of the summer.  Have a great Monday, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Hey everybody - good morning.  It&#x27;s a beautiful day today, and I know it first hand after spending some quiet time outside in the hammock.  Once I got past the awkward and embarrassing feeling of rolling my adult body into a hammock, it was pretty relaxing and tranquil.  But these days it feels like relaxation always comes at a price - heading back into the quiet house, I found a steaming hot anger poop from Minnie.  Breathe in - breathe out, right?

               Sip.  Yesterday was a tough day.  All my coded language around my job &quot;being a real grind lately&quot; and &quot;feeling like long days&quot; masked the kind of work stress that came to a head yesterday when we were driving back from the city.  I heard my phone ding, and the simple notification set off a panic attack.  I couldn&#x27;t formulate my words.  I couldn&#x27;t focus on road signs.  I pulled over and let Marissa drive us the rest of the way home, and before I knew it I was back in bed.  I couldn&#x27;t even summon enough concentration to send my boss a quick message letting him know I wasn&#x27;t feeling good and planned on laying down the rest of the day.  Work hasn&#x27;t been fun.  I wish I could just spill my guts about it onto this page, but sometimes you can&#x27;t freely talk about work without getting into trouble.  The less said the better.

               This only the third big panic attack I&#x27;ve had at this job.  The first time it happened about five years ago while I was wrapping up a huge project.  Halfway through a quick slack message to my colleague, the words on my screen morphed into strange shapes.  I couldn&#x27;t find any of the letters on my keyboard.  I thought I was having a stroke, so I went to the hospital.  The doctor asked some kind, empathetic questions my circumstances, and it didn&#x27;t take him much probing to find that this work project had been consuming my thoughts, even off the clock.

               I hate to believe that some things in your life can control your body, even if you&#x27;re not thinking about them in that exact moment.  Driving downtown with my family, I was in my happy place.  We had a great time.  Then a small notification sound - even before I registered what it was - made my body shut down in a panic.

               It was a tough day, but I&#x27;m thankful to have Marissa.  Panic attacks, fear, and anxiety have followed her around her whole life, and it&#x27;s easier walking through something with someone who has already been there.

               I&#x27;ll try to move past yesterday now, because before my panic attack we had a lot of good things going for this week.  On Wednesday, Marissa was supposed to drop off a painting in Chicago Heights.  I watched her cross the kitchen, sit down at the computer, and punch the address into Google maps.  &quot;Aaand, it&#x27;s an expressway party,&quot; she sighed.

               To Marissa&#x27;s relief, I suggested we all go together as a family.  Marissa hates driving on expressways, but it&#x27;s practically my favorite sport.  And all Marissa has to pay in return is listening to me geek out over Chicago&#x27;s interstate system, and maybe also let me take us somewhere new for lunch.

               &quot;We&#x27;re going to Gene and Judes,&quot; I announced.  &quot;My Driver&#x27;s Ed teacher made me take him here during one of our behind the wheel sessions.&quot;

               An hour later, weaving in and out of medium midday traffic, we parked in front of the unassuming hot dog stand along the Des Plains river.  Rodney went inside with me, clinging to my leg while he curiously studied the drab white interior.  There were no chairs, no decorations, no signage - just a high standing table top where you could scarf your hot dog before getting back in the car, if you choose to do so.

               I don&#x27;t remember much about my first trip to Gene and Judes - I was too focused on not crashing Mr. Maddaloni&#x27;s red jeep on the Eisenhower expressway.  My second trip was a lot better.  It&#x27;s kind of a strange hot dog - a minimalist take on a Chicago dog that only affords you mustard, onions, relish, and sport peppers.  But it was still kind of a neat experience.

               [figure gene-and-judes]

               They also pile all the fries on top of the hot dog, which we agreed was super silly.  Here&#x27;s a tip if you ever go - bring your own ketchup.  They take the whole &quot;real Chicagoans don&#x27;t need ketchup on their hotdogs&quot; trope pretty seriously, although it&#x27;s not obvious what they expect you to put on all these fries.

               [figure hot-fries]

               &quot;Oh, is that the finish line?&quot; I asked, seeing a group of people standing on the bridge.  &quot;I thought they were gonna let the ducks go all the way down the river.&quot;

               [figure bridge]

               But even that was assuming too much, thinking they would let the ducks float for a whole block.  It turns out they just dumped the batch off the Columbus bridge and immediately began scooping them up out of the river.  And thanks to a set of untrimmed hedges by the river, it all happened just out of our view.  We relocated to the other side of the river and saw half the ducks already bagged up on a dock.

               So we drove all the way downtown to watch a duck race, and we missed the whole thing.  But we were still in good spirits - it&#x27;s hard to have a bad time walking along the cool, shimmering water of the Chicago river.

               [figure family]

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Take care of your brains, watch your stress levels, and remember to save lots of work for Monday.  Have a great Friday, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, readers.  Happy Wednesday.  The coffee is hot and the first paragraph is fresh on the page.  Make yourself comfortable.

               Sip.  I did my best to get a good picture of all of us on the hammock.  Rodney has his hand in front of his face, but that was the best we could do in twenty tries.  Getting a good picture of your family on a hammock is kind of difficult to do.

               [figure outtake]

               But that doesn&#x27;t mean we haven&#x27;t been enjoying owning a hammock.  I think we&#x27;re all getting a little better at finding our center of gravity, and with each person that joins the party, you have to do the entire calculation over again so you don&#x27;t flip over.

               [figure more-hammock]

               Yesterday afternoon, we took a short hammock break.  Marissa, with her face and arms smeared with dirt from shoveling rock in the backyard, was first to crash.  The boys jumped on top of her.  I shimmied in from the side.  Rodney presumptuously handed me a book about dinosaurs and demanded that I read to the group.

               &quot;The stegasaurus is a unique dinosaur because it eats wingisses,&quot; I riffed.  &quot;It&#x27;s absolute favorite being Rodney.  But it is easily deterred by farts, which are known to be the stinkiest in the world and an effective defense mechanism.&quot;

               Rodney flashed a toothless grin.  As he laughed, he shook the hammock.  It doesn&#x27;t take more than a simple fart joke to make a six year old boy laugh, but it&#x27;s still rewarding.

               [figure ollie]

               It&#x27;s a good week to own a hammock.  Work has felt like a real grind lately.  Before sailing off to sleep on Monday night, an ominous meeting invite appeared on my calendar at 9 AM.  I took the day off writing, rearranged my morning, and showed up to the zoom call with my audio muted and my camera disabled.

               &quot;I was kind of half-paying attention to that one,&quot; wrote Derek afterwards.

               &quot;You didn&#x27;t miss much,&quot; I replied.  &quot;The main topic we discussed was moving the meeting to another time.&quot;  A meeting about rescheduling the present meeting - corporate life can be weirdly meta sometimes.

               At least the extra time in my morning didn&#x27;t completely go to waste.  With a quiet house and a fresh cup of coffee, I took a cozy seat on the couch and dialed a new friend of mine.  The two of us have been playing phone tag all week.  Maybe you&#x27;ve heard of this friend?  It&#x27;s the Daily Herald customer support department.

               I placed the first call - immediate disconnect.  Playing hard-to-get, as usual.  C&#x27;mon, friend - I know you&#x27;re there.  You said you&#x27;d be there for me... on Monday through Thursday from 6 AM to noon with a generous lunch break somewhere in between.

               I placed a second call, hammering out the incantation of number codes I memorized.  To my surprise, the sweet, dulcet robot voice said &quot;Goodbye&quot; and hung up again.  I must have made a wrong turn.

               I tried again.  This time I made it to the on-hold music.  That&#x27;s usually a good sign, but if you&#x27;re not careful, the music may lull you into a trance and you&#x27;ll miss the I&#x27;m still here prompt.  If you don&#x27;t grab the phone and press the &quot;1&quot; key, the polite robot will slam the door shut with a pleasant goodbye.

               I guess it&#x27;s finally time to admit why I was calling the Daily Herald customer support line.  It&#x27;s a little embarrassing in hindsight, but I signed up for the Sunday newspaper.  I think I was just excited about moving to a new city, and I was looking for a novel way to keep up with local news.  Even though I can get the same thing from scrolling my twitter feed or visiting a few credible news sites, I fully admit that I was in love with the image of myself reading a real life newspaper.  I thought of how sophisticated my dad looked thumbing through the paper.  I remembered how cozy it felt as a kid lying on the living room floor reading the Sunday comics.

               I signed up for the Chicago Tribune.  I read the first issue front to back, and it was a great way to kill time during the slow hours of manning Marissa&#x27;s art booth.  But they missed my paper for the next four Sundays in a row.  They stopped responding to my &quot;missed delivery&quot; text messages.  Taking my money for a whole month while only delivering one paper, I had no choice but to cancel the Tribune.

               I tried a different paper - the Daily Herald.  Their headquarters is practically down the street from my house.  I fell even more deeply in love with the idea of reading a more suburban, blue collar newspaper.

               I gave them my credit card number a month ago.  They never managed to get a single paper to my house, and after learning that they use the same crummy delivery company as the Tribune, I blame myself.  The more I thought about it, the sillier I felt.  Who signs up for a print newspaper in 2022?  I wouldn&#x27;t want to deliver a paper to me either.  I bet once the delivery driver caught a glimpse of me in my bathrobe trying to recreate a nostalgic Sunday morning memory from my childhood in the nineties, he scratched my address off his route forever.

               To add salt to the wound, the only way to cancel the Daily Herald was by calling their customer support line and talking to a human.  Hundreds of angry Yelp reviews and Facebook comments warned me that this was no easy feat.  I called their phone number every day during business hours.  Over the next week, I explored every option of their calling system.  Some mornings, the number didn&#x27;t even work.  Once out of curiosity, I called their sales department, and a lady begrudgingly transferred me back to call-waiting hell.

               I had been sipping coffee and listening to the on-hold music for so long, I forget about the task at hand.  The music abruptly stopped.  A still, small voice echoed on the other end of the line.  &quot;Hello?&quot;

               I scrambled across the couch and snatched my phone off the table.  &quot;Thank you for picking up.  Please cancel my subscription,&quot; I pleaded.  I couldn&#x27;t even hide the desperation in my voice.  I winced, hearing a metallic, whiny version of my voice play back in my ear with a half-second delay.  That&#x27;s another fun feature of the Daily Herald&#x27;s customer support line.

               The lady went to work.  I listened to her type on the computer for ten minutes.  &quot;May I ask why?&quot; she asked.

               &quot;Just... just leave it blank,&quot; I sighed.

               &quot;OK, Mr. Recker.  I stopped auto payments and terminated your subscription,&quot; she said.  &quot;You may still get a paper this Sunday, but that will be the last one.&quot;

               After making it through the whole call without showing any attitude, I finally broke character.  &quot;Ha,&quot; I chortled.  &quot;I seriously doubt that.&quot;  I should have known better to be so insolent to the one person that had the power to wake me up from my summer long newspaper nightmare.  &quot;Hmpff,&quot; she said, hanging up the phone.

               Please learn from my mistake.  Now is not a good time to sign up for a print newspaper delivery.  Print newspaper is a dying industry - not because they&#x27;re trying to keep it alive - but because newspaper companies are finally trying to get on the Internet just like everyone else.

               Thanks for stopping by today - have a great Wednesday.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everybody.  The sun is up.  The kids are wide awake.  According to my calculations, it&#x27;s Monday, and it&#x27;s time to get going with another work week.  Are you feeling ready to get busy again?  I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that my heart&#x27;s not in it yet, but I&#x27;m hoping that with enough coffee, I can just fake myself out into starting off this week.

               Speaking of starting off new things, did you know it was the first day of August?  This has felt like the fastest summer we&#x27;ve ever experienced.  At first I thought this was uniquely our family&#x27;s experience after moving in June and spending the whole month of July trying to get settled.  But all the neighbors I met at Dave and Pam&#x27;s wine party yesterday enthusiastically agreed - the summer of 2022 has been the fasted summer we&#x27;ve ever seen.  It&#x27;s sad to think about warm weather, late nights, and family time vanishing so quickly, but I have to admit the &quot;fast summer&quot; made for excellent small talk at the party.  It&#x27;s the kind of topic you can use to really galvanize a backyard full of strangers and loose acquaintances.

               [figure smalltalk]

               Ben set up at our kitchen bar and made us gin cocktails.  Mysterious concoctions poured over ice, shaken with egg white, stirred with lemon peels, it&#x27;s amazing how a good cocktail can tow the line between a sophisticated statement and a boozy, melted Popsicle.

               In other happenings of the weekend, Marissa and I spent a day outside in yard work.  Marissa mowed and fertilized the grass.  I bundled and bagged more brush.  As a byproduct of the work, we left a stack of stripped, sturdy fighting sticks for the boys to play with.

               [figure stickfighting]

               Remember when I brutalized our gutter with a U-haul?  We opened a new pair of metal sheers and successfully wrestled out the twisted pieces of debris.  We also bought some supplies to repair the missing segment, but it became clear that we were out of our depth with this type of repair.

               &quot;Hey, I think there&#x27;s a hole in your gutter,&quot; teased my neighbor Dave.

               [figure gutter]

               Later at the neighborhood party, I offered up my mishap with the gutter for banter.  &quot;It&#x27;s definitely not the first,&quot; laughed Dave.  &quot;One of their boys took out the brick, and ever since they weren&#x27;t allowed to park all the way up the driveway.&quot;

               Marissa and I also fulfilled a lifelong dream.  We finally have a hammock in our backyard.  Naps in the shade, gazing at stars, or maybe even watching a thunderstorm roll in - picturing all these moments, we had severely romanticized what owning a hammock would be like.  Just climbing into a hammock and finding a comfortable seat is no easy feat..

               [figure alex-hammock]

               Even Rodney, with all his learned ninja prowess, had trouble finding his center.  The hammock brutally flung him to the ground.

               [figure rodney-hammock]

               I guess we just need more practice.  That&#x27;s what I got today - have a great week, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  How are you feeling today?  Even after the world&#x27;s busiest Sunday, I&#x27;m feeling energized today.  Last night, Marissa and I installed a new shade over our bedroom window.  My first night of sleep without a lovely-but-rude burst of morning sunshine flooding our room at the crack of dawn left me feeling rested and thankful.  Now that I&#x27;m up, there&#x27;s only one place to go from here - head first into a fresh cup of coffee.

               Sip.  We sprung for the fancy shades.  They included this tiny, minimalist remote.  When you tap the down, a sleek wall of shade drops smoothly over the window, making a soothing humming sound.  It adds a nice amount of science-fiction flare to our mornings.

               Except there&#x27;s a small problem.  Right now it seems like the remote is the only way to move the shades.  Even worse, when the battery in the motor runs out, we have no choice but to unfurl an ugly looking power brick, attach it to the top of the wall, and run it all the way to the nearest outlet with an extension cord.  Next time I see sleek, wireless, self-moving doors and windows in a science fiction movie, I&#x27;m going to wonder if each of those motors need to be charged with a wall outlet.

               I&#x27;m talking about shades, so it should be no surprise to you that not much has happened in the last few days.  But it&#x27;s not like nothing happened, so let me regale you with the story of how Miles got this nasty goose egg on his forehead.

               [figure gooseegg]

               After we finished lunch, Miles and Rodney began to rough house in the dining room.  Rodney used his hands to cover Miles&#x27; eyes, and while giggling Miles tried to knock his brother&#x27;s hands away by shaking his head.  Miles head-butted the computer desk and stumbled away in a daze.

               Ziggy and I were just returning from our after lunch walk, and we saw the aftermath through the dining room window.  Miles wasn&#x27;t bleeding, but from behind the thin blue skin at the peak of the soft protrusion we could see a nasty bruise forming.  Marissa took him to a walk-in clinic.  The swelling subsided in the waiting room.  Miles, proud of how well he affixed his mask to his face, was too distracted to cry.  After a short visit with the doctor, he declared that Miles would be fine.

               [figure clinic: A masked Miles and Magnus await their turn to see the Harper College doctor]

               On the verge of being late to an agility class, Marissa called ahead before pulling into the driveway.  With the speed of a racecar pit-stop, she handed me Miles and I handed her Ziggy.  I set Miles up on the couch with a sippie cup of juice and some pretzels, and he sailed away into paw patrol bliss.

               I noticed two neighborhood kids riding their bikes and scooters around our cul-de-sac.  I rapped on Rodney&#x27;s door and asked him if he wanted to play outside.  Rodney would have rather scrubbed our toilets than quietly play in his room by himself, so needless to say getting out of quiet time to play with kids outside was a dream come true.  In a flash, Rodney dropped his lego&#x27;s to the ground and sprinted down our driveway, flagging down the neighborhood kids.  They exchanged some words, and Rodney immediately ran back to the garage to get his bike.

               I met the three of them in our backyard gathered around a pile of toys that Rodney had dragged out of the living room.

               &quot;Where do you guys live?&quot; I asked.

               &quot;We... we... live in SHAWM-BURG,&quot; said the oldest boy.

               &quot;In the neighborhood?  Which house?&quot; I replied.

               The two boys stared at each other in bewilderment.  The youngest boy just recited a house number from memory - no street, just a house number.

               &quot;We have to look both ways,&quot; he added.

               The older boy looked up, like he remembered something.  &quot;Do you know BOB [last name]?&quot;

               &quot;Is that your dad?&quot; I laughed.  The boys nodded.  &quot;I don&#x27;t know Bob, I&#x27;m sorry.&quot;

               Even though I had no idea who these boys were or where they lived, I had no choice but to let them continue to fiddle with Rodney&#x27;s Paw Patrol action figures in my backyard until they felt like going home - assuming they could find their way home.  Such is life in the suburbs.

               Luckily the boys&#x27; mom followed them into the backyard.  &quot;I saw a third boy and I wanted to check it out,&quot; she said.  Very sensible.  She explained that they lived only a few miles away, but they frequently visit their grandparents&#x27; house across the street from our house.  Things are a lot more comfortable when the adults finally have a chance to talk.  Me, the boys&#x27; mom, and their grandma chatted in the driveway, and once we all had a chance to perform our own mental &quot;creep&quot; check, we all felt better about the spontaneous play date.  Rodney followed the boys over to their yard where they played for another hour.  He returned with four freshly grown cherry tomatoes.

               &quot;I wanted to check with you before he ate any of them,&quot; said their Mom.  &quot;You know, allergies and what-not.  You never know.&quot;

               Marissa called me on the way home from agility.  &quot;Check snapchat, and call me back,&quot; she said.  In the first video, she was petting some friendly donkeys that were penned up oustide where she and Ziggy practiced.  In the next video, out of breath, she explained how she zapped herself on an electric fence while petting the donkeys.

               Flustered and laughing, she retold the story over the phone.  &quot;They said it was fine,&quot; she said.  &quot;I parked and left ziggy in her crate... and they were really nice and I was having fun.  But when I knelt down to take a selfie with them, the fence zapped me.&quot;

               Marissa screamed.  The donkeys bolted away from her in a panic.  &quot;Did you have your arm around them?&quot; I laughed.  &quot;They probably got zapped too.&quot;

               When she got home, I helped her record a quick video for one of her ink sponsors.  Still laughing about the electric fence that zapped her, I tried to convince her to submit this blooper as the final version.

               [video outtake]

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Thanks for stopping by, and have a great Wednesday.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Happy Monday.  After such a long, winding, action-packed weekend, it&#x27;s good be back at the computer where I have a chance to process everything that happened.  Writing is a form of therapy for me.  So is coffee.  How does your coffee taste these days?

               Sip.  A lot went down this weekend.  Rodney, accustomed to getting his energy out at the pool every morning with swimming lessons, woke up on Friday feeling despondent.  There would be no swimming lessons on Friday.  So Marissa mercifully packed the boys in the car and took them to the pool anyway.  On a quiet Friday morning at the Elk Grove Pavillion, Rodney rode the same water slide twenty times by himself.

               [figure pool]

               Some big news - we finally figured out how to open the blinds in our living room.  Sealed between panes of glass, we just assumed that they were forever stuck in the rolled down position.  But Marissa got curious and began to pry at one of the mechanisms controlling the blinds.  To her surprise, she discovered it was just a powerful magnet that controlled the gear.  She squealed with excitement as fresh sunlight poured into the living room.

               [figure blinds]

               On Saturday, we worked outside.  Marissa found an enthusiastic ant nest in one of the old pieces of wood edging she was taking apart.  Since I&#x27;m the family&#x27;s &quot;bug guy&quot;, I automatically assume all the dirty jobs that involve swarms of insects.  But I didn&#x27;t mind at all - the wood was soft and warm from the thunderstorm the night before, and it was fascinating watching crickets, centipedes, and isopods dart out from the cracks.  Meanwhile, the dogs went for a swim in the pit, which had filled with murky rainwater overnight.  My neighbor John, working on some of his own landscaping, leaned over our fence and quipped &quot;Eh, so you have a pool again.&quot;  Good one, John.

               That night, we went out to eat at Fat Rosies.  The waiter brought out sombrero&#x27;s for Miles and Rodney.  Like a professional child actor, Miles readily posed with the big, silly hat.

               [figure sombrero]

               Rodney was a different story.  Ever since we made him dress up like a chicken on Halloween, he gets a little feisty if anyone imposes silly outfits on him.  As soon as the waiter turned his back, he angrily shook the hat off his head, elbowing a full glass of water onto the table.  Spilling water - Miles&#x27; and Rodney&#x27;s signature move.  Sometimes Marissa and I feel like it&#x27;s impossible for us to get through a meal at a restaurant without one of these two idiots figuring out how to spill and entire glass of water onto the table.  But even with my sleeves and pants soaked with cold water, it&#x27;s hard not to have a good time at Fat Rosies.

               [figure fat-rosies]

               Rodney finally got to see their legendary bathroom prank.  Just outside the women&#x27;s bathroom, they have a fake mannequin standing in front of a fake urinal.  A tiny hidden speaker makes him grunt, fart, and even scold unsuspecting patrons for walking into the wrong restroom.

               [figure fat-rosies-prank]

               &quot;Can we have a low-key day tomorrow,&quot; said Marissa.

               &quot;Yep,&quot; I nodded in agreement.  &quot;All we&#x27;re doing is trying out a new church.&quot;

               &quot;Oh, and I have to drop off a painting downtown,&quot; she added.

               Once I knew we were parking downtown, my mental wheels began to turn.  Out of curiosity, I punched the address into Google maps.  I found it was right across the street from an L train stop.

               &quot;You know...&quot; I began.  &quot;We could take the boys out to lunch at Ed Debevic&#x27;s.  I mean, we&#x27;ll already have the car parked.&quot;

               Here&#x27;s the perfect way to describe how our Sunday actually unfolded.  You know how sometimes you have days that just get away from you, and the day ends before you can get anything done?  Well our Sunday was the opposite.  We set out to do the bare minimum, but we unintentionally turned it into one of the most action-packed Sundays in our family&#x27;s history.

               The action started with a last minute change of plans for church.  We planned to visit a low-key Presbyterian church in the morning, but practically at the breakfast table I convinced our family to try a non-denominational church.  The night before I scanned through some of the church&#x27;s sermons on YouTube, and if I&#x27;m being completely honest I just liked the music and the pastor&#x27;s thick West African accent.

               We parked.  We took a final glug of coffee.  We led the boys inside.  The first words we heard were WELCOME TO CHURCH followed by a jovial laugh.  The pastor I watched on YouTube was from Nigeria, and so was the rest of the church.  We found a seat in the back in the midst of an energetic, gyrating congregation belting out the words I&#x27;m gonna dance like a winner, man.  A quick scan over the room confirmed we were the only white people in the building, and the rest of the congregation took notice too.

               Sometimes this happens while church hopping.  You do your best to make an informed choice using google and youtube, but even a whole Saturday night spent googling a church still won&#x27;t keep you from accidentally taking your family to a Nigerian church.  I smirked to Marissa, telling her without words, OK this was a little unexpected, but let&#x27;s just get through it.

               &quot;Is there anyone here worshipping for the first time with us today?&quot; asked the pastor over vamping synth music.  &quot;Anyone here for the first time?  Just raise your hand now.&quot;

               As ridiculous as it sounds, I thought about keeping my hand down.  I felt like it was well-within my right to fly under the radar during our first visit.  But then I remembered we were the only white family in the building.  I proudly shot my hand straight up in the air.  The congregation erupted in applause.  Marissa and I were met with laughter and hugs from all directions.  From that moment, our visit wasn&#x27;t just a mistake and a funny story.  We felt embraced.  We connected with the message.  The congregation was passionate.  In that room, the Holy Spirit felt as close to me as the hot fog building up on the my glasses.  After the service, and earnest, heart-felt discussion in the back of the sanctuary with some of the church staff made us really believe that they wanted us to return.

               &quot;Am I crazy that I really liked it?&quot; laughed Marissa after the car door snapped shut.  &quot;I mean, Miles was a disaster, but we can leave him in the nursery next time.&quot;

               Already feeling out of our element, a hectic day downtown felt like a natural pairing with our African church visit.  Marissa held the boys&#x27; hands like vice grips while she anxiously waited for the train.  I saw Rodney&#x27;s jaw drop as it rushed into the station.

               [video train-coming]

               Rodney asked Marissa how she felt about the train.  She taught him what the word claustrophobic meant.

               &quot;How does the train make you feel?&quot; I asked.

               &quot;Proud,&quot; said Rodney.  &quot;Because I don&#x27;t have to walk through Chicago.  I can just ride the train.&quot;

               The red line saved us from walking, but Miles and Rodney still excitedly squirmed in their seat.  I blushed in embarrassment trying to contain the boys to their seats.

               [figure red-line]

               We finally made it to Ed Debevic&#x27;s.  Our kids were a little more oblivious than we had hoped, and they failed to pick up on all our waiter&#x27;s play snark.  It made things a little awkward, because each time he visited our table Marissa and I felt social pressure to show him how amused and appreciative we were with our tired faces.  But when they got up and danced on the table, Rodney finally wised up to their gimmick.

               &quot;This place is crazy,&quot; he said.

               Right on cue, before we left Miles spilled an entire glass of water onto the floor.

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  The rest will have to wait for another time.  Have a great Monday, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, friends.  Happy Friday.  Today the dining room feels quiet and inviting.  Beside me at the computer desk, our clownfish Ib and Ob happily chase each other around their new aquarium.  Their old place still sits in the hallway that leads to the back door.

               Why the relocation?  Their old tank got a little banged up during the move, and despite Marissa&#x27;s efforts she couldn&#x27;t get the water chemistry back to what it used to be.  So Ib and Ob get a fresh start in a new house - just like us.

               Oh and I forgot about the third fish, shy boy.  He&#x27;s still in the mix too, but he&#x27;s not as friendly as the clown fish.  While the clownfish adorably chase each other around the tank, he&#x27;s just leering at them from behind a rock.  Talk about a third wheel, right?

               Just like fish, I also need a carefully calibrated cocktail of chemicals to thrive in my environment.  On second thought, my creature needs are a little simpler.  The coffee just needs to be hot, brown, and laced with as much caffeine as possible.

               Sip.  It&#x27;s good to be here today, and thank you for giving me the day off writing yesterday.  It&#x27;s been a quiet week here at home recovering from a busy weekend, so there hasn&#x27;t been too much to write about.  The other day, Marissa ventured out to the new fish store in town, and she bravely took both the boys with her.

               &quot;I was trying to be cool mom,&quot; said Marissa.  &quot;But the boys were too much.  They drove me crazy.&quot;

               This happens to me and Marissa a little too often.  We get some free time, then we guilt ourselves into bringing the boys along in hopes of creating a precious memory.  Then when we&#x27;re on our way, we inevitably regret bringing them along.  I&#x27;m sure Marissa only got a few bites into her own breakfast before she began to question her decision to sacrifice a quiet morning errand.

               &quot;Rodney wanted to bring his hat, his gloves, and his other crap,&quot; she said.  &quot;But he got tired of carrying it, so she stuck it in my purse.&quot;

               &quot;Typical,&quot; I sneered.

               &quot;I was trying to keep Miles from touching stuff in the fish store, and then Rodney decides he wants his hat,&quot; said Marissa.  &quot;So he grabbed my purse and tugged, and he said stop moving mom.&quot;

               I began to chuckle, anticipating what happened next.

               &quot;I got really close to his face and growled CARRY YOUR OWN HAT,&quot; said Marissa.

               To help Marissa bounce back from the stressful concentrated bout of childcare, we took the boys to our staple Mexican restaurant.  We ate outside beneath tall trees and a symphony of screaming cicadas.

               &quot;This is actually kind of nice,&quot; I hollered over the drowning noise.  &quot;Miles can scream as much as he wants out here.&quot;

               [figure lalos]

               Can I speak about the bugs here in Illinois?  For the last handful of years I&#x27;ve spent living in Wisconsin, I convinced myself that there were more bugs there than in Illinois.  I chalked it up to swampy land surrounding the isthmus.  But now that we&#x27;re back in Illinois, it&#x27;s clear to me that there are a whole lot of bugs here too, and part of the shock of moving is just getting used to the common species in the area.  While taking out the garbage yesterday, this colorful beetle stopped me in my tracks.

               [figure bug]

               Wikipedia tells me this is the Eburia quadrigeminata or the Ivory Marked Beetle.  As a larva, it burrows into trees, and it can remain in solid wood sometimes for 40 years before it emerges as a colorful adult.  This beetle may have been alive in 1982.

               During the day I take Ziggy for walks around our neighborhood.  I kind of miss our old walking route from Madison.  Walking to the end of Union street and back was the perfect distance needed to digest lunch and get the blood moving.  Here in our new neighborhood, it feels like every combination of turns and side streets is just a little too long.  We battle the muggy weather, the hot afternoon sun, and the long gradual slope leading up to our house.

               [figure walks]

               In other news, Marissa&#x27;s fish tacos finally made it to Chicago.  While she cooked, I sat in my office on a Zoom camera chatting with my teammates in Melbourne and San Francisco.

               &quot;What pizza did you get?&quot; asked Janak.

               &quot;Not a pizza today,&quot; I replied.  &quot;Marissa is making fish tacos.&quot;

               [figure fish-tacos]

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Have a great Friday, everyone.  I&#x27;ll see you next week.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, friends.  Welcome to Wednesday.  It&#x27;s 8:30 AM, which means it&#x27;s time to write.  But first I have to close all of Rodney&#x27;s &quot;ABC mouse&quot; browser tabs.  Rodney has been putting in lots of time into computer games this summer.  He dug his personal pair of headphones out of his school backpack, and he found the aux input all on his own.  How about this - before we close all these browser tabs, let&#x27;s take a peek into what he&#x27;s been up to?

               I click his avatar.  It takes me to his virtual bedroom.  Not a lot going on in here, is there?

               [figure room]

               Putting this metal cabinet together was soothing.  There were only two types of screws to keep track of.  The pieces snapped and slid into their appropriate grooves intuitively.  At the very end, I peeled the sticky cellophane cover off the shiny metal table top.  I was grateful for this dumb chore I found in the middle of the day.  Internet or not, it&#x27;s proof that I did something yesterday.

               In other news, it&#x27;s swimming lesson week.  Rodney has a 30 minute slot at the local indoor pool every morning this week and next week.  I took him to his first lesson this past Monday.  The lady at the desk told us to find the lady in charge of swimming lessons so she could get him placed in the right level.  Rodney and I found her in the kiddie pool, so I sent him over to her.  Rodney sat down in the water.  She pointed to the deeper end of the pool, and Rodney shook his head.  They chatted for a few more minutes, then she led Rodney back over to me.

               &quot;Level 1,&quot; she said with a casual shrug.

               &quot;That makes sense,&quot; I chuckled.  &quot;He has pretty much zero experience.&quot;

               She handed Rodney off to another swim teacher where he practiced kicking his legs, floating on his back, and dunking his head under water.  But the best part of the morning swim lesson was drinking coffee for thirty minutes in a pool side lawn chair.  Morning swim lessons is prime quiet coffee drinking time.

               As I&#x27;m writing this, Rodney already bounces off the walls in his room.  He already changed into his swimsuit and swimming shirt.  I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell him that swimming lessons were cancelled this morning because of some kind of maintenance issue.  Hey, maybe their Internet went out?  It would be too sad to just make Rodney sit around at home, so Marissa is going to take him out to breakfast.

               In other news, Marissa and I are trying to catch up on work around the house.  The lawn needed to be mowed.  We had a mountain of cardboard that needed to be shlepped to the curb.  After night fell, I followed Marissa around with a flashlight while she sprayed turf builder on the lawn.

               [figure turfbuilder]

               Marissa stared off into the dark, cloudy sky and let the hose fall silent.  &quot;I don&#x27;t think I would enjoy being a farmer,&quot; she said to herself.

               Have a great Wednesday, everybody.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everybody.  Happy Tuesday.  The sounds of birds chirping and the copious amount of sunlight pouring in through the windows tells me it&#x27;s morning, and it&#x27;s time to start another day.  So let&#x27;s get to it.

               Sip.  I took the day off yesterday to recover from this weekend&#x27;s art show.  Marissa and I set up her booth at the Millennium Park art fair, which strangely doesn&#x27;t actually take place in Millennium park.  The fair was set up on Lake street between Stetson and Michigan avenue.

               [figure lake-street]

               [figure stetson-street]

               This was our view for the whole art show.  It was a cool, windy, drizzly weekend.  It was the kind of weather better suited for napping than selling art to strangers.  I admit, the gentle pattering of raindrops on the top of our translucent white tent made it hard to keep my eyes open during some of the lulls.  &quot;It sounds like a relaxing sounds YouTube video I would put on the TV before falling asleep on the couch,&quot; I chuckled.

               [figure buildings]

               Marissa and I, still suffering in the slump of a bad head cold, didn&#x27;t do much talking while we inched through the city streets in our U-haul.  That morning, a fateful miscalculation caused me to steer the U-haul right into the corner of our roof.  The top of the truck sliced through our gutter like a knife through the crust of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  You be the judge - does it look as bad as it feels?

               [figure gutter]

               The embarrassment of side swiping my own house with a truck would last all weekend, but luckily that was the only driving trouble we had.  Getting around the city gets easier with each art show, and sometimes even unplanned obstacles can lead you to new discoveries.  On the second day of the show, I dropped Marissa off at the corner of Michigan avenue.  I slipped into the turn lane just as a blur of tourists flooded the crosswalk.  I took the long, slow way back to our parking spot - waiting behind stoplights, busses, and pedestrians.  But just before I made the final turn, I noticed the street in front of the parking garage was closed.  Cars horns bleated behind me, and feeling pressed to make a quick decision, I turned onto a ramp that sent me straight down to Lower Wacker street.  &quot;Crap crap crap,&quot; I muttered to myself while I followed the dark concrete road through the bowels of the city.  I turned onto a ramp and surfaced, and to my surprise I was right back at Lake street where I had started.  It was inconvenient, but the next day when we had to cover the distance between the highway and Lake street, I simply recreated my mistake.  Emerging back onto the surface minutes later, we were magically teleported to Lake street, and I smugly basked in the glow of a new short cut.

               &quot;That was cool,&quot; said Marissa.  &quot;I felt like I was in The Dark Knight.&quot;

               Sadly, the art show this weekend was a bit of dud.  We blame the rain and dreary weather for the low turnout, but Marissa and I still had a good time.  Marissa brought a bag of dog treats along, and the side quest of petting as many dogs as possible kept us entertained.

               [video pets]

               We set aside one evening for a date night at Harry Caray&#x27;s.  We dove head first into a plate of bruschetta.

               [figure bruschetta]

               We had all yesterday to re-cooperate from a busy show weekend.  We took Miles and Rodney back to Bison Park.  Rodney explored the jungle gym on his own while Marissa and I sat and watched Miles fiddle with rocks in the stream.  &quot;Don&#x27;t throw the rocks, Miles,&quot; said Marissa.  Miles defiantly plunked a heavy rock into the water.

               [figure bison-park]

               We went out to dinner and took a long family shopping trip to Target.  I remembered to grab a basketball pump on the shelf.  Rodney yelped with excitement because it meant he would finally get to try his new Dude Perfect basketball we brought home from the show.  I used the ball as leverage over Rodney so we would quickly clean his room.

               &quot;If you clean your room in... five minutes... then you can shoot hoops outside,&quot; I promised.  I started a timer on my phone, and Rodney began to scoop Legos off the floor with razor sharp focus.  When he was done, he sprinted through the house to the back door.

               &quot;New Ball - who dis,&quot; he said while tying his shoes on.

               [figure new-ball]

               &quot;What?&quot; I laughed.

               &quot;That&#x27;s what Ty says in the video,&quot; explained Rodney.  &quot;New ball - who dis?&quot;

               Rodney said the ball was &quot;perfect&quot;.  We even tried some of our own trickshots, and I have to admit they felt that much more authentic using a real Dude Perfect basketball.

               [figure hoop]

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Thanks for stopping by, and I&#x27;ll see you tomorrow.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Happy Thursday.  Birds are chirping outside.  The kids are starting to wake up.  I&#x27;m here at the dining room computer clutching this cup of coffee, hoping the next sip of warm, dark liquid is the one that finally kick starts my brain into writing mode.

               Sip.  I&#x27;ve taken an unplanned break from writing this week, but you haven&#x27;t missed much.  Marissa and I took turns with an annoying head cold.  We think it started with Miles earlier this week.  It&#x27;s not always easy to tell when Miles is sick, since whining and drooling are kind of the status quo for a two year old.  At first we thought it was a delayed reaction to his first COVID shot.  Then we thought it was just a bad reaction from a mosquito bite on his forehead.  Finally Marissa woke up with the dreaded throat tickle, and it all became clear.

               She tested negative for COVID, but for a head cold this is a strange one.  This particular variety features a nagging headache, a drippy throat, and dry-throated sneezes that are so painful it makes us want to crawl into a hole.

               &quot;It could be worse,&quot; she reminded me.  &quot;We weren&#x27;t sick while putting together the swing set or during Rodney&#x27;s party.&quot;

               It&#x27;s never a good time to get sick.  Later today, Marissa and I are driving downtown to set up her tent for the Millennium Park art show.  Neither of us feel like we&#x27;re in top form, but at least today is just the set-up day.  Marissa and I will park the rented truck, dump all of our stuff on the sidewalk, and set up the tent like we have dozens of times before.  Knowing that some time tonight I&#x27;ll be back on the couch under a blanket with my favorite head cold cocktail also helps.

               That cocktail, by the way, is a warm mug of sleepy time herbal tea with honey, lemon, and a tall shot of brandy.  It&#x27;s best enjoyed with two gel Nyquil pills.

               Before I got sick, I took the boys on a spontaneous afternoon adventure so Marissa could peacefully nap on the couch.  &quot;How about we go to Sunset park?&quot; suggested Rodney.

               &quot;How about a new park?&quot; I asked.  &quot;Today let&#x27;s check out bison park.&quot;

               Bison park is a new addition to Schaumburg&#x27;s spring valley nature center.  I saw some pictures, but if I had known that bison park had a sprawling jungle gym, a rope tower, and a miniature creek, I would have given the boys more than just a half hour to explore.

               Rodney was stunned.  He joined the other kids, taking off his shoes and leaving them to the side.  He delicately stepped on the rocks, following the trickling stream under a low bridge to a tiny water fall.  &quot;Stick your head in it,&quot; I laughed.  Rodney obliged.

               Miles was more hesitant to jump in the water, but he found refuge in the tall rope tower, where he could observe all the other kids running around.

               [figure mingus]

               Our block of playtime was up, but we still had some energy to burn.  We hopped back in the car and drove to our all time favorite time waster in Schaumburg - the famous Woodfield Mall.

               [figure balcony]

               Are American malls a dying institution?  I hope not.  This mall is a sanctuary for wasting time with kids.  Even before I released Rodney and Miles into the play area, they wasted a whole twenty minutes running up and down that little flight of stairs in front of Macy&#x27;s.  We rode the fancy glass elevator to the top floor, then rode the escalator back down to the ground.  We shared a smoothie and a warm pretzel.  I hung back and let Miles and Rodney lead the way.  It was fun watching Rodney take charge, and also watching Miles copy his brother&#x27;s confident mannerisms.

               [figure copying]

               Just as we were about to cross the parking lot, Miles began to whine.  He pointed his little finger at the giant horse statues in front of PF Chang&#x27;s.  &quot;He wants to take a picture, like we did last time,&quot; said Rodney like Mile&#x27;s personal translator.  Easy enough.

               [figure horse]

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  The next entry will be next Tuesday, but if you&#x27;re around, please check out the Millennium Art fair this weekend.  Have a great Thursday everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               ROAR.  ROOOOAAAAAR.  ROOOAAAAAAARRRRRRRRR.  I know Rodney is awake because that&#x27;s the sound coming out of his room right now, filling the whole bedroom hallway.  I can also hear his remote controlled dinosaur&#x27;s tiny nails scrape across the floor and Miles giggle from around the corner.  I can&#x27;t fault Rodney for making so much noise this morning.  He barely had any time to play with his dinosaur last night after we popped a pair of fresh AA batteries into the remote.  He got about five minutes of robot dinosaur bliss before I made him crawl into bed for the night.  But I heard a few more growls after I turned the lights off.

               ROAR.  That&#x27;s an exuberant battle cry for this dry, cloudy Monday morning, isn&#x27;t it?

               Sip.  It&#x27;s good to be here today.  I took a bit of a break from writing so I could get in the zone for Rodney&#x27;s big birthday weekend, which officially started on Thursday night.  We bought two tickets to see the Dude Perfect live show in Chicago.  Sitting in my office chair for the last few hours of the work day, I felt a little like Rodney.  I wanted to get the boring part over with.  I wanted to skip ahead to the moment where Garret, Cory, Coby, Cody, and Ty jumped onto the stage.

               Donning our matching purple hoser t-shirts, we were ready.

               [figure dudes]

               I arrived home again with a sleepy, sugar-dazed Rodney a few hours later.  After putting in a whole evening shift, Marissa wasn&#x27;t even close to done with the swingset.  I put Rodney in bed, grabbed a beer, and joined her on the assembly floor.  &quot;She just needs a little organization,&quot; I thought.  &quot;I&#x27;m going to turn this pile of wood slats into an organized, grouped inventory of pieces to speed up the process.&quot;  But I couldn&#x27;t even do that.  There was hate and malice incorporated into every step of this swingset assembly, starting with the fact that almost every single piece of wood was different from the others.  On top of that, they were all identified by similar looking four digit codes stamped into the ends with faded black ink.

               [figure swingset-2]

               We joked that assembling this swingset was the most trying event in our entire marriage.  After five more hours, I&#x27;m not sure we were even joking about that anymore.  We worked in a quiet rage.  One of us would lash out and hit a breaking point, then we&#x27;d apologize and joke about it.  And we did this until three thirty in the morning - kicking bugs off our ankles, tapping rivets into place, trying to decipher the most half-assed instruction book ever written in the dead of night with a single flashlight.

               [figure swingset-3]

               I talked Marissa into giving up for the night.  She didn&#x27;t get her big reveal on Rodney&#x27;s birthday morning like she had hoped, but the boys were just as happy to watch us finish the job.  We raised the final beam into place.  &quot;Just so you know, it took us another three hours to finish it,&quot; I laughed.  &quot;It would have been an all-nighter.&quot;

               [figure swingset-4]

               We took Rodney to his favorite chicken finger place.  They brought him a brownie and icecream drizzled in fancy chocolate.

               [figure tavern-dessert]

               Uncle Jeremy and Auntie Kelly arrived, and cousins and dogs spilled out of the minivan.  Later Grandma Jane and Grandpa Dirk, then Uncle Philip and Auntie Sarah, and soon our neighbors would wander into our backyard too.  It was an awesome party.

               [figure party-watermelon]

               Thanks for stopping by.  Have a good week, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Hey everyone.  Good morning.  How does your Wednesday feel so far?  Over here it&#x27;s dark, cool, damp, and at the moment pretty cozy.  Continuing this theme, for today&#x27;s banner image I grabbed a picture of Minnie snuggling with her new favorite toy.  It&#x27;s a baby raptor.  Before Minnie claimed this raptor, she chewed one of the eye&#x27;s out.  Why would she do that?  Marissa suggested it was to keep her &quot;humble&quot;.  It probably only makes sense to Minnie.

               All this talk of coziness and snuggling leaves me in danger of nodding off right here at the dining room computer.  To stay awake and write, I need the help of a hot drink laced with chemicals.

               Sip.  I got a late start to writing.  First, thinking I had a late jump on garbage day, I threw on my robe and made the long trek down my steep driveway, dragging my cans behind me.  But nobody else had their cans on the curb, and this made me suspicious.  I turned to the Village of Schaumburg&#x27;s twitter account, and I found that garbage collection days have all been pushed forward one day to account for the holiday.  So I crossed the driveway again to pull my cans back to the side of the house.

               I guess that makes sense.  Somehow, back in Madison, our Tuesday morning garbage collection never fell on a holiday.  How many holidays fall on Tuesday - maybe Christmas every seven years?  But on the Tuesdays following labor day and memorial day, I thought about those poor garbage people needing to make up the extra day somewhere in the week on the heels of a holiday.  Here in Schaumburg, it seems they solve the problem by offsetting everybody&#x27;s collection day for the rest of the week, and that makes a lot of sense to me.

               We&#x27;ve got a good rapport going with the garbage people, but at the same time we&#x27;re sitting on a growing pile of waste, thanks to all the late projects in the yard.  We&#x27;ve got things bagged and neatly sorted around the corner from our garage where it won&#x27;t get in anyone&#x27;s way.  Bricks, wood beams, bags of balled up old tarp, and long rusty spikes that held in the wood edging around the pool - most of them still have little blocks of wood attached to them.  Marissa and I either need to find a dump to drop all this off, or we might call one of those &quot;1-800-get-my-junk&quot; guys we see on billboards.

               I&#x27;ve been rambling about our garbage for just a little too long, haven&#x27;t I?  Truth is, there&#x27;s not a lot going on in the middle of this week.  Our family is somewhere between recovering from this past weekend and preparing for Rodney&#x27;s birthday this weekend.  Marissa folded the seats down in our car and brought home his &quot;big ticket&quot; item yesterday.  Rodney thinks he caught a glimpse of the box from the side door.  His first guess was absolutely correct, so we had no choice but to just gaslight him and hope he forgets what it is by this weekend.

               &quot;It&#x27;s just a big box of little things.  Dad&#x27;s taking you to see Dude Perfect on Thursday,&quot; explained Marissa.  &quot;That&#x27;s your big gift.&quot;

               All good lies are built on a foundation of some truth.  On Thursday night, Rodney and I are seeing the Dude Perfect live show at the United Center.  In preparation, he re-watched their live tour movie on YouTube.  He wore his Dude Perfect shirt, even knowing we&#x27;d have to re-wash it before the show on Thursday.

               A lot of good things have been happening for Rodney lately.  Yesterday Marissa signed him up for some summer sports.  She let Rodney make the final decision, but we all knew where he would end up.

               &quot;It&#x27;s either basketball or ninja gymnastics,&quot; sad Marissa.

               We all know what Rodney chose.  This summer once a week at the Elk Grove pavilion, Rodney will learn the ways of the ninja.  At the end of the class, will there be a ceremony or a final ninja warrior challenge?  Will he have to fight his teacher?  Does he get his own sword?  We&#x27;re all eager to learn firsthand about the exciting new sport of ninja gymnastics.

               Lots of good things happening.  Hope your week is going well too.  See you all tomorrow.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Welcome back to the work week.  Just in case your house is also a mess and you too are feeling lethargic from a toxic mixture of beer and smoked meats in your stomach, why don&#x27;t we all just take it a little easy today - sound good?

               The house is starting to wake up.  I&#x27;m starting to push my luck with this sliver of morning silence, so I had better just get to writing already.  Assume the position, reader.

               Sip.  What a great weekend.  On Friday we hired the neighbor kids Anthony and Julia to watch the boys at our house so Marissa and I could go on a date.  It actually felt kind of nice to put on good clothes for a change.  Marissa and I grabbed a reservation at Seasons 52 in Schaumburg - and now comes the portion of the journal entry where you have to look at food pictures.  There was roasted corn flatbread.

               [figure flatbread]

               Juicy, lemony, seared scallop on a stick.

               [figure scallops]

               And a ruby red filet that was so tender, it melted off the end of the steak knife.

               [figure steak]

               Here&#x27;s a question.  Have you ever had a waiter that started off on the right foot with you, got confident with your rapport, then slighted you by the end of the night?  Our waiter complimented us on our food and wine pairings, and in the backdrop of a fancy evening dining room it was hard not to feel cool after that.  He specifically spoke highly of the baked shrimp, crab, and mushroom appetizer we ordered, but Marissa and I weren&#x27;t feeling it.  In fact, we left most of the mushrooms in the bottom of the dish.

               &quot;You... know you left some mushrooms here, don&#x27;t you?&quot; asked our waiter.  The second he walked away, Marissa wrinkled her nose, holding back laughter.

               &quot;Um yes, I know what food looks like,&quot; I retorted to myself.

               Marissa and I ordered some dessert - two small cups of chocolate cheese cake, and I floated the idea of some dessert wine.

               &quot;We don&#x27;t carry dessert wine anymore,&quot; said the waiter.

               &quot;That&#x27;s fine,&quot; I replied.  &quot;How about we share a pour of moscato or something.&quot;

               &quot;Too sweet,&quot; said the waiter sharply.  &quot;I&#x27;ll just bring out a pino griggio.&quot;  He turned on his heels and disappeared into the dim lighting.  Marissa and I stared at each other in befuddlement.

               &quot;Too sweet?&quot; asked Marissa.  &quot;Isn&#x27;t that the point of a dessert wine?&quot;

               I regret letting our waiter strong arm me like that.  With each sip of tart white wine, I winced in pain, exaggerating the effect just to make Marissa laugh.

               &quot;It&#x27;s actually very nice, after a meal like this you want to just erase it all with a really sour wine,&quot; I said, pretending to defend our waiter&#x27;s recommendation.  &quot;Trust me, by the time you&#x27;re done with this glass, you won&#x27;t be able to taste any of that steak.  It&#x27;s gonna scour it out like an acid wash.&quot;

               We spent a lot of time outside with the kids this weekend.  On Sunday night, we bought a back of novelty fireworks from Jewel.  But to our disappointment, the only fireworks you can legally buy in Illinois don&#x27;t really explode - they just make smoke.

               [video smoke]

               After Rodney and Miles went to bed, I disposed of the rest of the silly smokey fireworks.  But in good conscience I couldn&#x27;t just put live fireworks in the garbage.  So I tied all the fuses together and lit off a final giant smoke bomb in the driveway.

               [video big-smoke]

               Our neighborhood sounded like a thundering, thumping battlefield all weekend.  We watched the real fireworks on a blanket in the backyard.  Thanks to Rodney&#x27;s camera work, I can show you every single firework that we saw last night.  In fact, Rodney took so many photos, I could probably assemble them into an animated movie.

               [figure firework pics]

               The storms held off long enough for us to sit outside and digest our food.  Sarah brought out watermelon-vodka jello that she made in a real watermelon rhine.  It was hard explaining to Rodney and Miles that the bright red jello was only for adults.  Before Sarah and Philip left for the night, Rodney pulled Auntie Sarah aside.

               &quot;Next time, bring two watermelons,&quot; he said.  &quot;One of them just for kids.&quot;  Sarah looked crushed, like she had just accidentally stepped on a dog&#x27;s tail.  But there was no reason to feel bad for Rodney and Miles - they got their own jello cups, and they each ate three more smores after Sarah and Philip left.

               It was a good holiday weekend.  As a final treat, here&#x27;s some alluring footage from the bbq station, edited together in this nifty reel by my savvy Instagram influencer wife.

               [video bbq]

               Thanks for stopping by today.  Hope you all had a great Fourth of July weekend.  I&#x27;ll see you this time tomorrow.

               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  It feels good to walk into a Friday, doesn&#x27;t it?  It also feels nice to have a quiet house, but it almost wasn&#x27;t that way.  Miles saw my shadow on his bedroom wall and yelled &quot;DA-DA&quot;.  I stealthily closed his door, and I think he must have fallen asleep again.  That was a close one.

               It&#x27;s just me here this morning.  Ollie is sleeping somewhere in the house, and Minnie, perched on a bench by the front window, curiously watches a delivery guy getting in and out of a truck parked on our cul-de-sac.

               Right now I&#x27;m thinking about work.  I&#x27;m thinking about what movie I&#x27;m going to set up Miles with in about an hour.  I&#x27;m also thinking about this mug full of velvety, dark coffee sitting next to me on the table.  Did you bring a cup of coffee?  Good - bottoms up.

               Sip.  It&#x27;s just me and Miles again today.  Marissa and Ziggy are back in Rockford for day 2 of their agility trial.  Ziggy had a good run, but at this point in her career she&#x27;s plagued with almost perfect runs.  With Ziggy, it&#x27;s usually a small mistake at the beginning of the run followed by fifty seconds of flawless weaving and leaping.

               &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nNaCfWlP04Y&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

               Marissa sees this as very fixable, and I have to agree.  Little issues like losing eye contact, taking a wrong turn, or knocking a single bar will eventually get ironed out.  And once she does, Ziggy and Marissa will be unstoppable.  Picture a young Michael Jordan before he took the Bulls to the finals.

               [figure ziggy]

               Here was the scene back at home.  I call this &quot;lunchtime leftover chili club&quot;.

               [figure chili-club]

               We didn&#x27;t save any of that civil war bread, so we just had to make due with plain chili.  In a surprising twist, Miles actually took a few bites on his own.  Then he flipped the bowl over onto the floor.  He flashed a smarmy grin just to twist the knife.  He knew that meant &quot;game over&quot; and I&#x27;d have to pad his lunchtime calories with a cookie.

               I tried out a new type of work day yesterday.  I delayed my work day by exactly two hours.  I sat down to write a blog at 10:30.  I started work at 11:30.  I hung around online for our team&#x27;s evening meeting at 6 PM.  Only it wasn&#x27;t 6 PM for newly hired teammates Khris and Rowell.  For them, it was Friday morning.

               &quot;How&#x27;s Australia today?&quot; I asked.  Rowell shifted under his thick sweater.  &quot;Cold,&quot; he said.  Khris nodded in agreement.

               &quot;So that&#x27;s like, what, seventy?&quot; I teased.

               &quot;Alex, for them that&#x27;s like almost boiling,&quot; laughed Derek.   I forgot about the whole Celsius-to-Fahrenheit thing.

               It was nice to see our full team together in person.  Khris, Rowell, and I talk a lot over slack, but it&#x27;s harder to connect with someone that way.  When you talk in person, you can interject, ramble, and joke - not to mention read facial expressions and hear them laugh.

               The late-start workday was an interesting experiment, but it completely threw off my flow.  I&#x27;m accustomed to getting most of my work done in the morning at peak caffeination.  Starting work in the early afternoon, I felt like a car that couldn&#x27;t get out of second gear.  In fact, I probably wasted the better portion of my morning caffeine buzz watching Sing 2 with Miles.

               Next time we have an evening meeting, I think I&#x27;ll just try starting on time, then taking a long nap in the afternoon instead.  A siesta.

               My work call ended, and we scarfed down some pizza.  We all went outside to play some basketball.  Since moving into this house, our family has quickly found a new love for sports.  Maybe it&#x27;s just because we have the space for it now?

               I faced off against Rodney and Marissa.  I deftly dribbled around both of them for an easy lay-up.  Marissa air-mailed a shot and I immediately got the ball back.  But just as I was starting to feel confident, Marissa stole the ball back and hit a crisp mid-range jumper.  Her mouth gaped open in disbelief.

               &quot;I think that was the coolest moment I&#x27;ve ever had,&quot; she said.

               It would have been a competitive, heated game, but on the next play Marissa got her finger stuck in the strap of my wristwatch.  She whelped in pain and hobbled off to go find some ice.  Rodney took over dribbling, and he immediately jammed his fingers on the ball.  He dropped to the ground and started sobbing.  Miles, not wanting to miss out on the sympathy, dropped his own mini basketball in the grass and pretended to wale loudly.

               That&#x27;s one way to end a basketball game.  Thanks for stopping by today - have a great weekend, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, friends.  Happy Thursday.  This is kind of a late journal entry, isn&#x27;t it?  What the heck happened?  No - I&#x27;m not sleeping off a bender and I didn&#x27;t forget to set my alarm.  I&#x27;m just moving my day around a bit to make time for a meeting in the evening.  It feels weird to write so late in the morning while Miles hangs out in the other room.

               I put on the movie Sing 2, then I forgot to stand up.  With remote still in hand, I accidentally watched the first twenty minutes of the movie.  It took some will power, but I finally pried myself up from the couch to get going with things.

               First order of business: write a journal entry.  I&#x27;m going to need lots of coffee.

               Sip.  That&#x27;s the good stuff.  It&#x27;s just me and Miles today.  Marissa took Rodney to an agility trial in Rockford.  Ollie and Minnie are also floating around somewhere, but Ollie is making a deliberate effort to avoid Minnie.  I even let him sit outside by himself in the shade to enjoy some alone time.

               It&#x27;s been a long week.  Even though we&#x27;ve been in this house for almost a full month now, we don&#x27;t feel totally settled.  There are pockets of the house that feel comfortable - the dining room couch, the backyard, and my desk - but I still occasionally get lost trying to put things away.  Marissa was feeling the same kind of burnout keeping up with outside tasks.

               &quot;There&#x27;s a certain amount of work just to maintain everything,&quot; she explained.  &quot;Then on top of that, to change things to be the way I like them, it&#x27;s more work.&quot;

               We reflected on what it was like to move into our first house.  It was a ton of work, and yet we didn&#x27;t have any kids.  &quot;It was just Ollie,&quot; laughed Marissa.  &quot;He was so easy going about it, and it was still difficult.&quot;

               Now, having kids around colors this work with a new shade of difficulty.  Miles throws fits.  Rodney, with nothing to occupy his time, naturally tries to involve himself in everything.  Getting things done is so hard with them around, and yet we feel guilty just sticking them in front of the living room TV or sending them to their rooms for long quiet times.

               Yesterday, I planned on picking up groceries alone.  But I made eye contact with Rodney as I passed through the hallway.  I also heard Miles thumping around awake in his crib.  So I guilted myself into taking both boys along to the grocery store.

               On a whim, we checked out a new grocery store - Valli Produce on Roselle Road.  After driving by it on other occasions, Rodney knows it as the store where &quot;grandpa Dirk used to take me to&quot;.  More eclectic and diverse than our usual Jewel, I felt equally overwhelmed and excited with all the choices on the shelves.  We picked up a pack of Spanish cookies.  I helped myself to Polish paprika, Indian curry powder, and freshly ground Mexican cumin.  I grabbed a head of garlic that was the size of a softball.  They had fresh packed honey comb, chia seeds, and giant cans of imported tomatoes.  I was just supposed to pick up enough items to make simple leftover pulled pork chi, but admittedly I went a little overboard.

               And all so cheap too!  If I had bought all that stuff from a Trader Joe&#x27;s or from the Willie Street Co-op back home, I probably would have drained our checking account.  Somehow, all these fresh vegetables, interesting snacks, and authentic spices only amounted to forty-four dollars.

               The chili tasted fantastic - like our own personal melting pot of flavors.  But the packaged cornbread I grabbed off the shelf was a crushing disappointment.  For starters, it needed a whole extra ten minutes of baking time.  The bread was heavy, dense, and flavorless.  Somehow, it felt like it was diluting the taste of the chili.

               And so we each took turns roasting the packaged cornbread I brought home from Valli Produce.

               &quot;This is civil war bread,&quot; I said.

               &quot;Is this what the first bread tasted like?&quot; asked Marissa.

               &quot;This is what hermits eat during lent to remind themselves of their own sin,&quot; I laughed.

               Miles crumbled a brick onto the floor - his way of joining in on the fun.

               [figure civil-war-bread]

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Have a great Thursday, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, friends.  Happy Wednesday.  I should have started writing a minute ago, but I got stuck petting my dogs.  When I got up to take a shower, Minnie moved to my side of the bed, and I&#x27;m not just going to walk by without petting her.  Do you have any friends that are consistently a few minutes late for things?  It&#x27;s nothing personal, they probably just have a dog that they like to pet when they are on their to do things.

               Sip.  The work continues, and burnout is starting to creep up on us.  Marissa put in a long shift in the backyard today.  She finally reached the end of the walkway.  Watching a lot of Better Call Saul these days, she felt inspired to call our new walkway &quot;the camino&quot;.

               [figure camino]

               At work, I&#x27;m wrapping up an on-call shift.  The long work day got to both of us, and when it came time to make dinner plans, we were already mentally in sync.

               &quot;Village Tavern?&quot; Marissa asked hesitantly.  I dramatically bobbed my head up and down in agreement.

               The Village Tavern is this cozy little bar just west of our house.  Their claim to fame is their chicken fingers, and we have yet to really order anything else off the menu.  Maybe it&#x27;s because of the time we spent in Wisconsin, but we immediately picked up on their big secret.

               &quot;This tastes exactly like a fish fry,&quot; I said with a mouth full of food.  &quot;But instead of fish, it&#x27;s chicken.&quot;

               &quot;It&#x27;s genius,&quot; added Marissa.  &quot;The worst part about eating fried fish is the fish.  And they just replaced it with chicken.&quot;

               A mere fifteen bucks gets your five of their massive chicken fingers.  I only have the stomach to finish three of them.  Between all of our unfinished plates, we came home with enough chicken to eat for lunch the next day.

               Our dinner plans changed, but I had already promised Rodney we&#x27;d take a drive to Jewel.  So Marissa and I schemed a last minute surprise.  &quot;I&#x27;m going to take him to the used sports equipment store next to Jewel and buy him a baseball glove.&quot;

               Marissa helped lay the trap.  She strolled through the hallway while Rodney was strapping his sandals.  &quot;So for dinner tonight, we&#x27;re having something with a lot of onions, right?&quot;

               Rodney made a bleh noise under his breath.

               &quot;Yep,&quot; I nodded.  &quot;Lots of onions... and potatoes too.  Just kind of a simple onion and potato meal.&quot;

               I broke the news to him after he climbed into the car.  &quot;We&#x27;re not going to Jewel,&quot; I smiled.  &quot;We&#x27;re gonna get you some baseball stuff.&quot;

               &quot;Yeah,&quot; Rodney replied.  &quot;AND we&#x27;re going to get tennis stuff too, because I want to play tennis.&quot;

               What a dingiss, right?  A minute earlier he thought he was going to Jewel to buy potatoes and onions.  I make a big deal out of surprising him with some baseball gear, and what does he do?  He tries to pile on some tennis gear too.  At any rate, we had a great time at the used sports store.  We bought him a red batting helmet and a new wooden bat.  But buying a glove proved to be tricky - they had limited options for left handed throwers.

               &quot;Um, actually I can throw with this hand,&quot; said Rodney, holding up his right hand.

               Rodney was telling the truth.  I&#x27;ve seen him throw with both his left and right hand, and they&#x27;re indistinguishable.  &quot;Are you sure?&quot; I laughed.  &quot;I mean, they have barely any lefty gloves here, there are a lot more righty ones to choose from.&quot;

               &quot;Sure!&quot; said Rodney flippantly.  Problem solved - just like that, he declared himself a right-handed thrower.

               We drifted to other areas around the store.  Rodney handed me a lacrosse helmet.  &quot;Try this on,&quot; he instructed.

               [figure helmets]

               I strapped him into hockey pads.  &quot;Do you feel tough?&quot; I asked.

               [figure chest]

               He tried on a goalie glove and a blocker.  He was fascinated by the hidden leather glove tucked behind the blocker.

               [figure goalie]

               &quot;These are perfect for beat-the-crap,&quot; he laughed, slipping on a pair of boxing gloves.

               We played some baseball in the yard before we left for dinner.  Baseball is kind of like the piano lessons of sports.  Like a lot of kids, it was one of the first organized sports I tried when I was little.  All the specific rules and techniques are still ingrained in me.  Without thinking, I began to dispense advice to Rodney that he never asked for.  &quot;Hold your glove out ahead to catch, and squeeze it around the ball when it gets to you,&quot; I instructed.  &quot;Don&#x27;t lead with your wrist, because the ball is gonna bounce of that soft spot under your hand and hurt.&quot;

               &quot;Um, actually in baseball, you can catch the ball however you want,&quot; said Rodney.  He seemed annoyed, but he was making an effort to be polite.  He stuck out his hand, leading with his wrist.  The ball gingerly landed in his glove.  &quot;See?  It didn&#x27;t bounce out,&quot; Rodney said.

               Rodney even invented his own baseball traditions.  &quot;In baseball, your name is da-da-ba-da,&quot; he said.  &quot;I would say, hey, da-da-ba-da and you would say &quot;hey rodney-ba-da.&quot;  Surely, he must have heard me someone say hey, batter batter and got his wires crossed, but he was convinced that this was how baseball players addressed each other.  So I humored him, and made an effort to mix in some &quot;lessons&quot; from Rodney into our play -  that&#x27;s the least I could do.  Sometimes I launch too quickly into &quot;teacher mode&quot;, and Rodney is quick to remind me that he likes to learn things on his own.

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Thanks for stopping by, and have a great Wednesday.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, friends.  How&#x27;s your Tuesday going so far?

               I&#x27;m feeling pretty good today - well-rested and energetic.  I&#x27;ve got a quiet house to myself too.  I don&#x27;t think Rodney is sleeping, but the important thing is that he pretends to sleep for just another hour.

               &quot;How long is an hour?&quot; asks Rodney.  I always respond the same - &quot;count to sixty sixty times.&quot;

               Rodney started counting nine minutes ago, so we had better make use of the time.  Grab your cup of joe, and let&#x27;s go.

               Sip.  I&#x27;m back to work this week, and so is Marissa, returning to the rock shlepping fields.  But despite all the exciting shoveling and bucket carrying on her plate, a wet spot in our grass distracted her.  We noticed the damp, marshy square of sod when we first moved in.

               &quot;Where is it coming from?&quot; she questioned.

               &quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; I said.  &quot;It&#x27;s the lowest part of the ground - that&#x27;s just how water works, right?&quot;

               Marissa threw a few buckets of sand on top.  It seemed to soak up the water, and at the very least that would keep the dogs from rolling in it for a while.  I was happy to put the issue out of my mind, but Marissa didn&#x27;t forget about it so easily - especially when the water came back.

               &quot;Look,&quot; she said, stabbing it with a shovel.  &quot;The water is coming up from below.&quot;  She tossed a shovel scoop of wet sand to the side, and the impression immediately filled with dark water.  She got down on one knee and reached her hand into the swampy abyss.

               &quot;I can feel something,&quot; she said.  &quot;It&#x27;s... it&#x27;s some kind of tube.&quot;

               A tube?  No longer a random act of nature, a man-made tube introduces a new plot twist.  Whatever was bubbling water up into our lawn was put there intentionally.

               Marissa used a bucket to bale out water.  Now with both her knees planted in the mud, she pried up the mysterious tube with her finger tips.

               &quot;It&#x27;s... a gutter?&quot; I said.

               &quot;But why does it just end here?&quot; asked Marissa.  &quot;I guess this is easy to fix.  We just need to extend the gutter to the fence.&quot;

               I stepped away so I could make a phone call to the Village of Schaumburg permit office.  The lady on the phone in passing mentioned that run-off gutters can&#x27;t terminate closer than five feet to the property line.  Crap.  Well that explains why the gutter just ends in the middle of the yard.  Even though sending the water into a flat rock bed would have made sense, we understood the spirit of the rule.  You can&#x27;t just dump your rain water into your neighbors yard.

               So what do you do with a bunch of water that you don&#x27;t want?  I have to admit, the problem was kind of exciting.  I had never looked at a piece of property this way.  Our roof, our driveway, our yard became a giant puzzle for moving water.

               &quot;What if we just dig it out, and fill it with rocks,&quot; I suggested.  &quot;The rocks won&#x27;t soak up the water, and if it&#x27;s deep enough, that will keep bugs from laying eggs in it.&quot;

               &quot;Can we just collect it in a barrel?&quot; asked Marissa.  &quot;I mean, we could empty it when it gets full.  Is that dumb?&quot;

               &quot;No, that&#x27;s what a rain barrel is, right?&quot; I replied.  &quot;All the hippies in our old neighborhood had those big jugs of dirty water around their house.&quot;

               Marissa&#x27;s idea to collect the water was, in fact, not crazy.  It&#x27;s called a &quot;cistern&quot;.  It&#x27;s a jug buried under ground.  But instead of emptying out whenever it&#x27;s ful, newer cisterns are designed to leech it into the surrounding earth more slowly than it would just pouring freely out of the gutter.

               &quot;We&#x27;ll have to call JULIE again,&quot; smirked Marissa.

               Between the two of us, only Marissa got her hands dirty.  I got a free pass from yard work so I could keep an eye on our dinner.  In the morning just before work started, I plopped a seasoned pork butt on my smoker, stoked a fire, and let it cook all day.  When my watch timer rang, I felt a flutter of excitement in my heart like I had just woken up on Christmas morning.  I dragged the wad of towels and tinfoil out onto the counter.  I peeled back the wrapping.  A puff of pure smoky goodness seeped into the air.  I made a shallow stab with a simple dinner fork, and the mass of meat began to fall apart.

               I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with me.  I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t try this sooner.  I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t listen to everyone else who has raved about the simplicity, utility, and sheer deliciousness of homemade pulled pork, but I&#x27;ve finally seen the light.

               [figure pulled-pork]

               After dinner, I took Rodney and Miles to the park.  Sunset park was a hopping scene.  Bikes and scooters littered the sidewalk.  Parents mingled and kids of all ages dashed through the playground equipment.  Rodney, eager to make a friend, confidently joined an older kid on the monkey bars.  I could tell from this kid&#x27;s body language that he wasn&#x27;t in the mood to meet Rodney, but Rodney missed the memo.  Rodney chased the kid around for fifteen minutes before he turned around and sharply told him &quot;I&#x27;m not playing with you&quot;.

               Rodney shrugged off the terse encounter, and in no time a huge group of kids and parents invited Rodney to play a game of capture the flag.  There were rules, teams, and new people to meet - Rodney was in heaven.

               &quot;DADA PLAY WITH US!&quot; yelled Rodney.  I waved and motioned toward Miles.  &quot;I gotta be on Charles Mingus duty,&quot; I replied.  A half-excuse, I didn&#x27;t feel like sprinting around a field with strangers on a belly full of pulled pork meat, so I just tottled around the tennis court with Miles instead.

               Miles cross the tennis court to meet me where I stood on the fence.  He stuck out his hand and planted it on my stomach.  &quot;TAAAAAHG,&quot; he yelled, then he clumsily ran in the other direction.  I guess one of the other kids in the park must have taught Miles how to play tag.

               That&#x27;s what I got today - thanks for stopping by, and have a great Tuesday.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Are you ready feeling ready for a Monday?

               I&#x27;m still waking up too, so why don&#x27;t we just set the scene here from where I&#x27;m writing.  It&#x27;s a sunny day, and from this chair in the dining room I can hear birds chirping from all directions.  My neighborhood cul-de-sac is quiet and empty, but there&#x27;s a single dirty tennis ball sitting in the middle of the road.  Did we put that there?  Rodney has a pretty good arm, but I don&#x27;t think he could knock a ball quite that far into the air.

               The predominant feeling in my body right now is soreness.  My fingers feel soar, my right shoulder feels sore, and this comfortable computer chair is hitting my back in all the right places.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, though.  I&#x27;m not complaining.  If anything, I&#x27;m subtly bragging about all the work we got done this weekend.

               Sip.  Ugh, that&#x27;s the good stuff.  Coffee tastes so good these days.

               We spent a good amount of the weekend hauling cube as we like to call it.  Hardly an accurate description for the chore of moving buckets of sand and rock, but nevertheless &quot;hauling cube&quot; is just kind of a fun thing to belt out across our backyard while we work.  It&#x27;s a thing from The Office - if you know, you know.

               [video hauling-cube]

               So why exactly do we have a giant pit in our backyard?  This is what was leftover from tearing down old pool.  It&#x27;s an unforgiving mixture of sand and rock, and there are other fun things like rubber and tarp mixed within too.

               [figure jobsite]

               Working a few buckets at a time, we&#x27;re moving the clean rock to a skinny strip of land between our fence and the neighbor&#x27;s fence.  With no hope of fitting a lawn mower back there, our next best choice is to make a nice looking rock pathway.

               [figure camino]

               Working between the two fences is tricky business.  Marissa uses to metal chairs to awkwardly clamber her way in.  I employed the help of Rodney.  His lightweight five year old frame made it easy to just throw him into the walkway.  He slithered around tree trunks and underneath branches with a pair of scissors while the two of us collected the neon color twine left over from zoning the new fence.

               I was on bucket dumping duty most of the day.  Trainer Greg would have been proud of how I straightened my back and engaged my core while slowly walking buckets of rock and sand across the yard and to the back fence.  &quot;Hey, nice farmer&#x27;s cary, bro,&quot; quipped Marissa.

               It was tough work, but it felt kind of cathartic and meditative in a way.  Miles and Rodney contentedly fiddled in the big pile of sand.  The dogs slept in the shade.  There were no distractions, save the occasional taunt from my neighbor John.  He periodically checked in with us from his side of the fence to see if we had yet discovered any buried treasure.

               Thankfully, the weekend wasn&#x27;t all labor and toil.  I had a chance to fire up my new Weber Smokey Mountain.  I&#x27;ve had mixed results smoking meat on my standard Weber Kettle.  While it&#x27;s totally possible to convert a Weber Kettle to a makeshift smoker, frankly it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  My first experience with an actual meat smoker left me flabbergasted with each little convenience I discovered.  There&#x27;s a side door for accessing the burn chamber.  There&#x27;s a wide, heavy water dish that shields the food from direct heat.  The ideal &quot;smoke zone&quot; range was colored in to an easy-to-read thermometer on the top lid, and the smoker magically stayed at the correct temperature for hours.

               Marissa and I like to do this thing where we pretend to write satirical headlines for The Onion using embarrassing moments from our lives.  My Onion headline for the day was &quot;Local Man Discovers Smoking Meat Much Easier with an Actual Meat Smoker&quot;.

               The results were satisfactory.  The beef short ribs practically fell off the bone.  My hungry family devoured them like animals crouched around the fire.

               [figure ribs-1]

               [figure ribs-2]

               In other news, Marissa started on Rodney&#x27;s bedroom mural.  After he got all fired up about the theme of &quot;dinosaurs playing sports&quot;, Marissa had to talk him down to simply &quot;dinosaurs&quot;.  She kicked things off with a giant T-Rex that wrapped around his wall.

               [video dino-painting-timelapse]

               &quot;Where are its teeth?&quot; asked Rodney teasingly.

               Maybe Marissa should consider a new theme - toothless dinosaurs.  Rodney is certainly losing a lot of teeth these days, and maybe he would really connect with that kind of motif.

               [figure dinosaur]

               Thanks for stopping by today.  Have a great Monday, folks.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Hey, everyone.  Good morning, and welcome to the old journal.  Sitting here in my dim dining room just beyond the closed shades, I can hear a flurry of birds chirping.  It&#x27;s sort of inviting.  But it&#x27;s going to take more than just some dumb birds to encourage me to open the dining room windows.  I like how dark it is in here right now.  I will choose to sit here in darkness with this hot cup of coffee, like some kind of coffee addicted computer troll.

               Sip.  That&#x27;s the good stuff.  I had kind of a rough time letting the dogs out this morning.  Their big new backyard is messing with their heads.  Ziggy keeps over-working herself, feeling compelled to chased down her sister instead of helping herself to the several water bowls we&#x27;ve set out.  Minnie seems to have more stamina, but she has so much fun bolting around the yard during potty breaks that she forgets to go potty.

               This morning, I saw her bolting up and down the fence line, teasing the neighboring German Shepard Ramses.  At least from what I could see out the kitchen window, it was a flirtatious gesture.  But in the end I had to head outside to leash up Minnie, and escort her to the other side of the yard so she could do her business without the distraction of a tall, dark and handsome German Shepard.

               As icing on the cake, Minnie dashed into our bedroom and lept onto my side of the bed before I noticed her paws were muddy.  She tracked tiny muddy paw prints on our clean white sheets leading up to Marissa&#x27;s pillow.  Minnie - I say this with fatherly love - some days I want to just make you an outside dog.

               It&#x27;s been a heads down kind of week.  There&#x27;s still lots of work to catch up on before closing out the week.  And I have yet to put in some hours of my own for rock moving duty.  But I&#x27;m still excited for the weekend because I&#x27;ll have time to play with the cool stuff I got for Father&#x27;s day.

               [figure i-love-highways]

               OK, so this was more of a joke gift.  One night Marissa and I were walking around in Chicago after one of her art shows, and we crossed a bridge that overlooked I-90.  I decided to shared some facts about I-90, and thanks to the few beers I had I got a little carried away with the enthusiasm.  I think I even uttered the words &quot;I LOVE I-90&quot; loud enough for people to hear me on the other side of the street.  A fitting gag gift for the embarrassing sound bite.

               Just for the record, the construction of I-90 may have been our country&#x27;s greatest achievement in transportation engineering.  It&#x27;s the longest stretch of highway in America spanning all the way from Seattle to Boston.  Surely I can&#x27;t be the only one that&#x27;s amazed at the thought of driving across the entire country on a single road.

               The real gift is sitting out in the backyard under a grill cover - a Weber Smokey Mountain.  Honestly, I&#x27;m surprised to find myself getting the urge to smoke meat again.  Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m back in Weber country.  Maybe it&#x27;s because we have this big beautiful backyard.  All I know is I&#x27;m smoking meat on Saturday, and I&#x27;m going to eat most of it after moving buckets of rocks across the yard.

               In other news, Rodney lost another tooth - his front tooth.  Marissa and I held back snickers listening to Rodney adapt to his sudden difficulty with s&#x27;s, but once he heard it for himself he was a good sport about it.

               &quot;Hey dude, do you see any slithering serpents over there?&quot; I asked.

               &quot;Nope, no th-lithering th-erpent-ths,&quot; laughed Rodney.

               Marissa and I have been a little wishy-washy about the tooth fairy.  Rodney even admitted that the last time he lost a tooth, &quot;Mom just gave me some money out of her purse.&quot;  Left to assemble all the facts for himself, Rodney&#x27;s final understanding came out a little muddled.

               &quot;Tell uncle Jeremy,&quot; he said, holding his tooth close to his chest in bed.  &quot;He&#x27;s a dentist, and he can bring me money.&quot;

               &quot;How much money do you want?&quot; I replied.

               Rodney stared up at his ceiling.  &quot;Sixty... sixty-five thousand dollars,&quot; he said with a clumsy lisp.

               I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do with that request, so we took a night to think about it.  The next day, Rodney was ready with a compromise.  &quot;I want a coin,&quot; he said.  &quot;But I don&#x27;t want any fairies to come into my room.  Can you just give me a coin?&quot;

               &quot;Yeah if you want,&quot;  I said.  &quot;How about we do it while you&#x27;re sleeping so it&#x27;s a surprise.&quot;

               Rodney was satisfied with that, but he was still worried about looping the tooth fairy into the new plan.  &quot;What if she tries to get in?&quot; he asked.  Rodney leaned over my shoulder and watched me draft a text message.

               &quot;Hey TF - you can skip Rodney tonight?&quot; I read while typing.

               Pretending my phone vibrated in my pocket, I pulled it out and pretended to read it off the screen.  &quot;No problem!  Tell Rodney I said congrats - TF&quot;

               Despite our planning, Marissa decided to go rogue.  She wrote a note with the coin and signed it &quot;from the TF&quot;.  As I&#x27;m writing this, Rodney is trying to sort out what happened.  Thinking on my feet, I read another fake text message from my phone.

               &quot;Hey, noticed you forgot to leave Rodney money last night.  Hope it&#x27;s OK, but I took care of it - TF,&quot; I said.  &quot;Wow.  Sorry dude, we were so tired we forgot.  Good think the tooth fairy took care of it.&quot;

               Rodney stared blankly ahead.  Eyes filled with wonder, he slowly walked back into his room to process what had happened.

               Kids are fun, aren&#x27;t they?  That&#x27;s what I got today. Have a great weekend, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everyone.  Happy Thursday.  How&#x27;s the work week going so far?

               Things are busy.  I jumped back into work on ticket duty, and on top of everything I still get lost in my new house.  Of course I can find the basement, the bathroom, and the cleaning closet if I have to, but it just takes a little more mental energy since the autopilot hasn&#x27;t kicked in yet.

               We have work to do, and we&#x27;re going to get it done.  Swagger favors the bold, and I know that&#x27;s true because I read that on my bottle of body wash in the shower this morning.  Also, we don&#x27;t have to do this alone.  We&#x27;ve got a secret weapon that rhymes with shmoffee.

               Sip.  It&#x27;s good to be here.  There&#x27;s a lot going on this week.  I can gripe about sitting on the computer all day answering slack messages as long as it&#x27;s not within earshot of Marissa.  She spent all day yesterday hauling buckets of rocks across our backyard.  Now that our fence is put in, there&#x27;s a strip of grass between our fence and a neighbors fence.  Marissa covered the area in tarp and plans to cover it in rocks.  What&#x27;s the easiest way to move rocks across your yard?  That&#x27;s kind of the point - there is no easy way to do that.  Just grit, sweat, and a well-deserved beer when you&#x27;re done.

               She needed more supplies for the job, so we accompanied her to Home Depot.  Rodney climbed through the driver seat while Marissa unbuckled Miles.  The long stretch of blacktop in front of the store felt like I was walking across a solar cooker.

               &quot;I think Home Depot has a terrible layout,&quot; said Marissa, wiping a drop of sweat from her face.  &quot;I used to think it was just the one in Madison, but now I think they all do this.  Home come no matter where you park or what you have to get, you end up walking across the entire store?&quot;

               I felt relieved to hear the complaint from her.  Only a few days earlier while buying sandbags for her outdoor art show, I got completely lost in that same home depot.  &quot;And when I finally found the exit, I realized I grabbed the wrong cart and I had to go back and get four more sandbags,&quot; I laughed.

               Marissa loaded up the car while Rodney and I screwed around.  I hoisted him up to the high metal bar where you drop off the carts.  I quickly stepped out of frame so we could get the perfect &quot;action shot&quot; of Rodney hanging there by himself.

               [figure hanging-out]

               I guess he&#x27;ll figure it out one day.  That&#x27;s what I got today - thanks for stopping by, and I hope you have a swell Thursday.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Hey everyone.  Good morning.  How is everyone feeling today?

               I just finished letting the dogs out.  Everything that happens pre-coffee tends to be a little fuzzy, and that&#x27;s why at first I didn&#x27;t even realize that our backyard fence was finally finished.  This morning, I wouldn&#x27;t have to take each dog outside individually with a leash.  I just cracked the back door open and let them tear into the yard - what a relief!

               The dark ages are finally over.  No more boxing out my dogs when I head out into the back yard.  No more locking the door each time I leave for fear that Miles will accidentally let them out.  No more escorting Ollie around while he patiently sniffs out the perfect poop spot (a small insight into the mind of Ollie, there is no such thing as the perfect poop spot, but Ollie will always look for it anyway).

               It&#x27;s funny watching how each dog enjoys the new territory.  This morning, Minnie and Ziggy tore around the backyard, forming a single black, white, and grey blur.  Ollie just waltzed around the yard at his leisure, probably just enjoying the privacy of his morning poop without an impatient chaperone.

               Sip.  It&#x27;s good to be here today.  It&#x27;s Wednesday, and around this neighborhood, Wednesday is garbage day.  I lugged both of my cans to the edge of the driveway last night, carefully pulling the cans out so I wouldn&#x27;t disturb the fat toad sitting beside them.

               [figure toad]

               Marissa and I are just happy to have a normal garbage day for a change.  Last week, we had twelve lawn bags, eight bundles of brush, a stack of metal blinds, some sawed up furniture, and an intimidating mountain of tied up cardboard.  Feeling self conscious about all the garbage, we were afraid that the neighbors were going to think we were hoarders or something.  With anticipation, we all stared out our front window with anticipation as the big green trucked heaved to a stop.

               &quot;Here - go run out a snack to him,&quot; I said to Rodney.  I dashed to the fridge and grabbed a cheese stick out of the bottom drawer.&quot;

               &quot;Uh, that... that&#x27;s OK you do it,&quot; Rodney stammered.  I shoved him out the front door anyway.  He cautiously approached the driver with a cheese stick in hand.  He grinned and waved Rodney over.

               &quot;Hey, you just bought this house, right?&quot; hollered the garbage man.  &quot;Look, put your cans here next time.  &#x27;Den I don&#x27;t have to get out of da&#x27; truck.  I&#x27;ll be around for another five years!&quot;

               I flashed the driver a thumbs up.  I&#x27;m glad we started off on a good foot with the garbage man.  Have you ever pissed off a garbage man?  That can be a difficult relationship to repair.

               We had a busy weekend, freshly moved and heading into an art show in downtown Chicago.  When it was all wrapped, we decided to use our last day of moving vacation to treat ourselves.  We took the boys to Legoland, located in the Streets of Woodfield.  My old Starbucks has closed down.  Before we even entered the building, we marveled at the strange combination of stores that now occupied the once bustling outdoor shopping center - a comedy club, an Omaha Steaks, a Nordstrom Rack, a Jamba Juice, and a competitive axe throwing club.  We would have to explore axe throwing another time - we were there for Legoland.  Miles and Rodney ran straight towards the giant Lego bricked giraffe that towered over the door.

               [figure leela]

               Thanks to all the LEGO library books he checked out in kindergarten, Rodney was well-versed in his Ninjago lore.  He posed for pictures with cardboard cutouts of each ninja, and he seemed a little star struck.

               [figure ninjago]

               [figure sensai-wu]

               My Legoland favorite would have to be the Chicago replica.

               [figure chicago]

               Transformer robots and dinosaurs stomped around Navy Pier.  Dozens of little flashing cop cars piled in front of a stage headlined by the Lego Blue&#x27;s Brothers.  Little Lego tourists took selfies in front of a more blockish rendition of The Bean.

               [figure chicago-2]

               At the end of the visit, we let Rodney pick a new Lego set.  The dirty trick about Legoland is that there&#x27;s a slight markup on everything they sell.  The twenty dollar dragon we bought for Rodney probably would have cost ten or fifteen dollars at Target.  I was just grateful that Miles didn&#x27;t want anything - he was content staring at the giant glowing wall of LEGO pieces.

               We left the store, and to our surprise an employee chased us down just before we crossed into the parking lot.  Without saying anything, he knelt down by Rodney and handed him a LEGO figurine.  &quot;It&#x27;s Kai from Ninjago,&quot; said Rodney happily.  The employee awkwardly waved, then ran back into the store.

               &quot;That was really nice,&quot; said Marissa.

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  Have a great Wednesday, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, friends.  How are we feeling today?  I&#x27;ll tell you how I&#x27;m feeling today - grateful.  I&#x27;m grateful for the long break from work, and I&#x27;m grateful to be back in the writing seat on a beautiful morning.  I&#x27;m also feeling cautiously optimistic that I&#x27;ll have no problem firing up the mental blogging machine for the first time from this exotic new location.  Teeth brushed?  Check.  Kids wide awake banging on their bedroom walls?  Check.  Adequate caffeine levels?  Eh, it could be better.

               Sip.  This morning, I&#x27;m writing from our new house in beautiful Schaumburg, Illinois.  I&#x27;m sitting at our makeshift family computer setup in the dining room.  There are some unopened moving boxes on the wall behind me.  At the table, I&#x27;m flanked by potted plants, folded up curtains, a giant bottle of Korbel Brandy (don&#x27;t get any ideas, Alex, it&#x27;s a work day), and some other random things that we haven&#x27;t put away yet.  Life feels a little up in the air, but I can proudly say that all this stuff is here to stay.  We&#x27;re permanently moved.

               I have some fuzzy memories from the turbulent phase of our family history we call &quot;the U-haul period&quot;.  We filled four U-haul trucks with stuff, driving each one over the Wisconsin-Illinois border.  When you spend that much time with U-haul&#x27;s, it starts to feel like a way of life.  We became U-haul people.

               [figure uhauls]

               With each batch of material comforts shuttled away, our old house felt strange.  Our living room had a drowning echo.  Rodney&#x27;s room felt so eerie with just a cot in the corner.  During our final days in Madison, we ate takeout food on the hardwood floor and sat on boxes to watch TV.

               [figure tv]

               Packing the final truck felt exhilarating.  We packed our living room couch in the back corner.  We neatly arranged boxes on the back wall.  As soon as we were sure all of our remaining stuff would fit, the moving process delved into chaos.  Marissa siphoned fish tank water into five gallon buckets while Rodney helped me arrange my tarantula collection in the passenger seat of the U-haul and tuck all the lose items into dresser drawers.  Last to board the caravan was Ducky, who would endure the bumpy drive in a hole-punched tupperware bin.  We took one last tearful walk through our empty house.

               [figure goodbye]

               Powerful emotions accompanied every step of the process.  Leading up to our final moving day, I joked with Marissa that at the moment we crossed the Wisconsin-Illinois border for the last time, I would &quot;scream like Jesse Pinkman in that scene from Breaking Bad&quot;.  As promised, I screamed as loudly as I could, but it probably didn&#x27;t sound very loud through the other end of our walkie talkie.

               I appreciated the long break from work and writing.  We slept in.  We tried restaurants.  We landscaped in the backyard and rearranged furniture.  The last few weeks have felt like a vacation.  But I think the next step in getting settled in this place is real life - work and focus, healthy meals, responsibilities, and a sense of identity.

               One quick story before we go.  Did you know I met former president Obama the other day?  I bumped into the beloved Chicagoan this past weekend.  He was gracious enough to take a picture.  For a such a quick encounter, Obama seemed very well put-together.  He didn&#x27;t say much (actually he seemed kind of artificial with me), but I&#x27;m just happy he was gracious with me bothering him for a picture.

               [figure obama]

               Thanks for stopping by today.  See you tomorrow, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everybody.  Welcome to Monday.  I really wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d have enough energy to write this morning, but it seems like a hot shower and a cup of coffee turned it around.  Suddenly I feel like sitting, looking at pictures, and writing in the old journal.  Did you bring your coffee?  Good - let&#x27;s do this.

               Sip.  Our time in Madison is coming to a close.  I fully expect these final days to slip away in a single exhausting blur.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m grateful for yesterday - our last friend day in Madison.  We opened up a tab at the Malt House and sent some invitations to neighbors and coworkers.  We filled up a whole picnic table on their patio, which I think is a pretty good turnout for a drizzly Sunday afternoon.  As cars whizzed by at head level on the other side of the bushes, we collectively marveled at how much the neighborhood has changed over the years.  When Marissa and I say &quot;we&#x27;ll visit often,&quot; we mean it - if anything, just because we want to see what happens to our street.

               Inside the bar, Miles and Rodney had full run of the place.  It wasn&#x27;t a busy day, but the guy posing at the bar for his band photo shoot seemed irritated working around a drooling baby and the chatty five year old.

               [figure bar]

               What&#x27;s there for a kid to drink at the Malt House?  Ice cold lemonade right out of the bar gun.  Normally we cut them off after two, but we let them go a little crazy so we could give our favorite bar a good send off.  Coworkers, neighbors, and everyone who came out, thanks for the fun evening.  Stop by our place next time you have to drive to Ikea.

               [figure malt-house-napkin]

               We spent this past weekend at the new house.  We barely made it home in time for our own party.  Regrettably, our trusty family car has been on the fritz.  Driving there on Friday, we had to hug the right lane of the highway because the &quot;vehicle stability assistant&quot; kept turning on without warning and stalling the engine.  What is it about moving that makes things break at once?

               More bad news.  I didn&#x27;t succeed in setting up the Internet at the new house.  My new house has a coaxial input in almost every room, but mysteriously none of them seemed to be hooked up to the Internet.  JR, the very patient customer support system and I spent an entire hour trying each input in the house.  JR was so determined to find a plug that worked, it almost seemed like he wanted to deprive Comcast of the extra hundred dollar installation fee as much as I did.  But we gave up, set up an appointment for the following weekend, and just embraced another tech free camping weekend.

               Miles slept outside in his crib.  I bet the cool, evening air felt nice on his legs after sitting in his cramped car seat all morning.

               [figure sleeping]

               Marissa engaged in a serious bout of landscaping work.  She had to clear space for the fence getting installed, hacking down a jungle of thorny branches, sappy pines, and itchy leaves.  The commotion attracted some neighbors.  First to meet us was Daniel, joining his German Shepard Ramses at the back gate.  I&#x27;m not sure if I was just feeling shy or really focused on dismantling a metal awning, but I decided to let Marissa take this one.  Daniel had a thick Polish accent.  He laughed heartily at Marissa&#x27;s jokes.  Marissa explained that we were putting in a fence for our dogs.  Daniel turned to his dog Ramses and said &quot;See what you did?  You idiot.&quot;

               For our dogs, they recommended Ramses&#x27; favorite snack - frozen chicken feet from the Polish grocery store.

               &quot;My friend bought some for her dog, and she trimmed the nails on the foot,&quot; laughed Daniels&#x27; wife Ania.  &quot;Of course you don&#x27;t need to trim its nails.&quot;

               Marissa continued hacking down branches, turning the corner of our lot.  John, our other neighbor, came out to greet us.  &quot;Those are mine,&quot; he warned, waving at the bushes Marissa was cutting.  &quot;BUT KEEP GOING!&quot;  His jovial laugh instantly quelled our embarrassment.  John introduced us to his dog Ruby.  He chided us about getting rid of our pool, which he jokingly referred to as his &quot;backup pool&quot;.  He also said his name wasn&#x27;t really John.

               &quot;I&#x27;m Janesh,&quot; he said.  &quot;And Daniel over there is Polish too, but his name is actually Jhanesh.&quot;

               Marissa battled the landscaping around our yard.  I battled the pool.  We&#x27;re paying the fence guys extra to take down the pool and the deck, and to hedge some of the cost we&#x27;re selling the valuable stuff on Facebook.  Armed with a newly purchased PVC wrench, I was tasked with dismantling the intimidating pool filter.  Hunched over in the sharp rocks while ants crawled around my ankles, It was challenging finding the right fittings to turn.  But I got the damn thing out.  The great turning point of the battle was when the towering grey &quot;missile system&quot; toppled.  It reminded me of seeing rioters topple that statue of Saddam Hussein on the news ten years ago.

               [figure filter]

               We put the kids to bed.  Without any screens to watch, Marissa and I just decided to embrace the home camping weekend and sit around the fire outside.  Plus we had lots of extra brush to burn.  We ate smores and compared the sores and cuts on our hands.

               [figure bonfire]

               That&#x27;s what I got today. Thanks for stopping by today, and have a great Monday.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everybody.  It feels good to turn the corner into a Friday, doesn&#x27;t it?

               Just to set the scene here - the house is quiet.  After Marissa dropped Rodney off at school, she left with Ziggy for an agility trial on the other side of town.  Holding it down here at home is just myself, Miles, and a bunch of animals (minus one dog).  I think I heard Miles beginning to wake up.  But don&#x27;t worry, he&#x27;s accustomed to sitting in his crib in the mornings, so why not squeeze in a journal entry in the meantime?

               That also gives me more time to drink coffee in silence.  Drinking coffee - in this moment, it&#x27;s my favorite thing in the world.  Cheers.

               Sip.  Am I going crazy, or is they&#x27;re a big green alien staring at me through our dining room window?

               [figure alien]

               Oh right - that&#x27;s our moving truck.  Our third moving truck.  We took a slow and steady approach to moving.  One weekend at a time, one U-haul truck at a time, one interstate caravan at a time.  Last night, Marissa and I packed up her studio.  She tied a stack of paintings upright in the back with string.  We filled in the spaces with frames, supplies, and boxes of spray paint.  In truth, this load wasn&#x27;t too difficult.  It actually felt a lot like packing for an art show, which is routine for us by now.

               I parked the U-haul so that the giant green alien graphic on the side of the truck was leering into our dining room.  The sight stopped Miles in his tracks on his way up to bed.  He would have started crying at the sight if we didn&#x27;t calm him down.

               We&#x27;re spending this weekend at the house, and we&#x27;re going to leave after work today.  The drive is just under two hours.  Still battle-hardened from driving up and down Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin last weekend, two hours sounds like a cake-walk.

               This weekend we&#x27;ll finally have Internet at the new place.  I opened an account with Comcast.  It felt like I was making a deal with the devil.  Comcast is kind of a slimy company.  I had to walk through their online &quot;plan builder&quot; several times before I understood where all the extra charges come from, and they employ some dirty tricks to pad things.  For example, all new plans are quoted at a much lower price, and after 2 years when this &quot;promotion&quot; expires the monthly rate shoots up by thirty bucks.  They also hold you to a data cap, and you pay out the nose for each gigabyte if you go over.  Of course for an extra monthly fee you can unlock unlimited data, but they don&#x27;t let you sign up for that when you create your plan.  But what am I gonna do, not use Internet?  Besides, I&#x27;d do much worse things to finally get on gigabit Internet.

               How about some pet news?  Minnie got spayed this week.  The evening she came home, still groggy from anesthesia she pitifully slinked around the house with droopy eyes and heavy feet.  At least she was extra snuggly.  The next morning, she was back to her energetic self, and even though the vet advised us to help her down the stairs while her stitches healed, Minnie was too fast for me in the morning.

               At least she doesn&#x27;t have to put up with a silly plastic cone.  We bought her a tight fitting sweater that accomplishes the same thing, except it&#x27;s a little more comfortable.  Plus, the streetwear-esque blue camo must make her feel a little glamorous too.

               [figure minnie]

               Even more pet news - I bought a new spider yesterday.  It&#x27;s a Lasiodora parahybana, also known as the Brazilian Salmon Pink Bird-Eater.  He&#x27;s a little guy with an inch and a half leg span - still a few years away from coming into his full grown 8-9 inch bird eating form.

               &quot;Does it eat birds?&quot; asked Rodney.

               &quot;No, they just call it that because it&#x27;s big,&quot; I replied.  I laughed at the image conjured up in Rodney&#x27;s imagination hearing the term &quot;bird-eater&quot;.  Did he think we would be feeding it birds every night?  &quot;Bird eater&quot; is more of a clout name - they eat bugs just like all the other spiders.  But maybe we&#x27;ll give him one bird every year on its birthday, as a treat.

               My new spider sat in a small dirt crater in the center of a sealed deli cup.  I placed it on the glass countertop and took out my wallet when I started to chat with the guy behind the counter.  I detected he too was a fellow spider weirdo, especially when I noticed him pull up his Instagram.  He politely waited for a pause in the conversation before he showed me a gallery of his spiders.

               In that moment, the weirdest thing happened.  Just as I handed the guy my credit card, I saw my new spider flip onto his back.  &quot;OH... oh he&#x27;s literally molting like right now,&quot; said the flustered shop owner.

               Here&#x27;s the tricky part - it&#x27;s not a good idea to move a spider while it&#x27;s molting, let alone take it on a bumpy car ride.  So what to do?  The shop owner graciously offered to keep it there overnight while he finished up.  &quot;He&#x27;ll be done in a few hours, and you can pick it up tomorrow,&quot; he said.  &quot;As long as he&#x27;s still alive.&quot;

               That&#x27;s what I got today.  If you&#x27;ll excuse me, I have to go eat some apple jacks with a toddler in front of a giant green alien head.  Have a good Friday, everyone.

    <content><![CDATA[
               Dear Journal,

               Good morning, everybody.  Happy Thursday.

               Has it been almost a week since the last journal entry?  Things are moving too fast lately.  I meant to bring you up to speed yesterday.  I sat down at the computer at 8:15, downloaded some pictures from my camera reel, and scrawled some notes down.  I wrote the opening paragraph.  But my stomach had other ideas, and I had to take a rain check on the journal entry.  I suppose an extended holiday weekend in the car eating fast food will do unpredictable things like that.  Our family achieved a new level of closeness, thanks to the long drive from Wilmington, Ohio.  When you spend that much time in the car, things blur together.  The car felt like a tired extension of my body.  Childish back seat fart noises, raspberries, and shrieks bounced around in my head like they were my own thoughts.  &quot;My body feels like a giant cheeto,&quot; as Marissa put it.

               [figure fast-food]

               [figure window]

               We terrorized the hotel hallways.

               [figure hallways]

               But most of the time, this was our view.

               [figure watching-nickjr]

               You could argue that at the heart of our trip was a twenty-four hour Nick Jr tv marathon.  My boys, who have little experience with the wonders of live TV, were spellbound.  Sometimes when a TV commercial plays, Rodney gets up from his seat as if it&#x27;s a YouTube ad and there&#x27;s a button to click past it.  They have a lot to learn about the real world.

               You might notice Rodney is wearing swim goggles.  He wore goggles the entire time.

               [figure diamond-in-the-rough]

               A turning point for our trip.  What are the chances that we found this diamond in the rough?  Let me tell you this - if you find yourself in Wilmington (assuming you aren&#x27;t hog tied in someone&#x27;s trunk), make sure you hit up El Dorado&#x27;s for some genuinely delicious local Mexican food made with love.

               [figure dairyqueen: There&#x27;s a pretty good Dairy Queen Grill and Chill nearby too.]

               Thanks for stopping by today.  Have a great Thursday, everyone.
