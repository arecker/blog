<p>
My job is sending me to San Francisco for training.  While this
doesn't sound like a big deal to some, I haven't done a lot of
traveling.  Just take a look my Google Maps data since graduating
college.
</p>

<p>
I haven't been on an airplane in probably a decade.  I've never
traveled alone.  I really have no idea how airports or other cities
work.  For your amusement, I've decided to document my trip as I go,
focusing on my mistakes and confusion.

<p>
I departed this afternoon from Madison's only airport.  It was
quaint, and just about everything the air travel experience should
be.  Even the fellow that makes you remove your belt and shoes under
threat of a baton beating was no more authoritative than they should
be.
</p>

<p>
When I arrived at the gate, we soon were shepherded to an airplane
that was so small, it looked like it was cut out of a museum exhibit
meant to teach kids about airplanes.  It was a proper metal cigar
tube with wings.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="old/images/cigar-tube-with-wings.jpg" alt="cigar-tube-with-wings.jpg" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>My brave steed, apparently.</p>
</div>

<p>
But after buckling into my prime window seat, we were asked to
leave.  The pilot called the delay a "VIP movement".  Apparently
there was somebody traveling through O'Hare airport who was so
important that all other planes needed to wait until he was done.
The unenthused stewardist clarified that it was President Barack
Obama.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks Obama!" I whispered.  Nobody acknowledged my joke.  Perhaps
it was too "on the nose".
</p>

<p>
After milling around in the airport for another hour, we were told
to board in the same fashion.  Pavement, stairs, window seat,
seat belts, and finally lift off.
</p>

<p>
The flight was comically quick.  We were only in the air for
twenty-seven minutes.  I swear I've made the same drive in only two
hours.  During the flight, we were assured that since the delay
affected all flights in an out of Chicago, any connecting flights
were likely still viable.  That was good news, but I figured I had
better just treat it like it was still the same time printed on my
ticket.
</p>

<p>
O'Hare, in contrast to the Dane County regional airport, is a war
zone.  People were practically stabbing each other for AC outlets.
Parents shoving Mcdonalds cheeseburgers into their kids' mouths.
Additionally, navigating this airport was considerably more
complicated.  My target gate number looked like a foot note out of
an obscure academic journal.  I followed its promise through a
churning sea of angry, weary people.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="old/images/ohare-the-zoo.jpg" alt="ohare-the-zoo.jpg" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 4: </span>Just look at these savages&#x2026;</p>
</div>

<p>
To my horror, arriving at gate H-11-A I beheld the great walkway
retracting.  Despite what I had been assured, my connecting flight
hat not been delayed.  It was still taking off at 5:00 PM, and I had
arrived at 5:10 PM.
</p>

<p>
As I waddled over to the desk, relinquishing my wife's blue polka
dotted bag to the ground, a furious bald man stepped in line in
front of me.  Veins swelled around his temples.  He had that "I'm
about to make a scene" look about him.
</p>

<p>
"We need to be on that plane!"  He yelled and pointed his big
muscular arm at the attendant.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, we closed the gate ten minutes ago.  The walkway has already
been retracted.  That's not possible."
</p>

<p>
"Well get us on another flight!" he hollared.  His laser-guided
trimmed goatee seemed to bristle.  The attendant yammered at a
keyboard.  I knew what the answer would be before she said it.
</p>

<p>
"There are no more seats on that flight, sir."  The man clenched his
fists.  His female companion, clad in glossy exercise clothes rolled
up behind her.  She read his frustration and joined in the
beratement.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see how it's our fault that Obama delayed our flight!
That's not fair."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Obama" I whispered again.  They did not acknowledge my
joke.  I pulled out my phone and stared at my lock-screen.
</p>

<p>
"Look!  We're doctors!  We NEED to be in San Francisco tomorrow
because we have patients to treat!  Are you guys going to treat our
patients instead?"
</p>

<p>
My thoughts drifted.  I imagined walking into a doctor's office
being greeted by an American Airline's employee.  "Good morning.
Your doctor's flight was delayed, so the airline sent me to check
your prostate."
</p>

<p>
"Honey," yelled baldy.  "They don't give a RAT'S ASS about us."  The
two stormed away.  I sauntered up to the counter after them.
</p>

<p>
"Hi&#x2026; I think I have the same problem as that angry guy."  The
attendant smirked as I continued, handing her my ticket.  "I was
supposed to be on that connecting flight."  She proceeded to work on
the computer.
</p>

<p>
Wanting to capitalize on our rapport, I added "&#x2026;and I'm not a
doctor, so feel free to take your time."  The woman started
laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Don't worry about it - you were put on the next flight out.  Your
plane leaves in two hours."  My mouth dropped in amazement.  "And
feel free to tell that angry guy that you got the last seat."
</p>

<p>
Which brings me here - Dear Reader.  Hunched over a wobbly table for
one, charging my phone at a sticky power outlet that I may or may not
have stabbed somebody for.  And I can't help but feel lucky.  Now if
you'll excuse me, I need to get to gate <code>H-EE-V-31.2 article
4b. (iii)</code>.  Hopefully sometime tonight I'll be somewhere in San
Francisco - unless Obama manages to screw that up too.  Thanks,
Obama.

<p>
I get the impression that people who fly are supposed to appear
disinterested.  I'm doing my best to fit in, but it's all just so
exciting.  I'm attentive to everything mumbled over the airport
loudspeaker.  I smirk as the plane lurches forward like a spaceship
on the runway.  My face is practically pressed on the glass when the
plane banks, revealing a wildly new perspective of the familiar
Chicago skyline.
</p>

<p>
I finally get to ride in a plane big enough for me to stand in - not
that I'll be doing much standing.  The plane is 100% booked.  I kept
an eye out for the angry doctor duo from earlier.  Part of me feels
guilty for taking what could have been their seat.  Part of me
wonders if I have any blood on my hands.  Let's hope for the sake of
my conscience that they were just plastic surgeons and they were
late for a tattoo removal or something.
</p>

<p>
Everything on an airplane seems a lot tinier than I remember.  I
feel like I've been making T-rex arms for the past three hours.  I
could get a little more room if I tipped my seat back, but we've
been in the air for at least an hour and I feel like that would be
totally unfair to the guy behind me.  Everybody knows that if you
don't change your seat within the first five seconds of sitting
down, you really can't change it at all.  It's a binding social
contract.  The guy behind probably has his heart set on keeping the
extra 1.5 inches of leg room.
</p>

<p>
Correction.  He has a neck-pillow.  Everybody knows that if you use
a neck pillow in public, most social contracts don't apply to you.
Sorry buddy.

pretending he's on a spaceship barreling towards Mars.

Well against all odds, I made it. Sorry I don't have any pictures of
my digs yet.  I rolled into the hotel at what was biologically 2AM,
threw my stuff on the ground, and just sort of collapsed.  Five
hours later, I my phone stirred me from my coma and I realized I
didn't have any toothpaste.  I also realized I don't know where
anything is.
</p>

<p>
I mimed several fake phone calls while I did my best to look like I
was intentionally walking in zig zags.  I already have a good
navigation tip for you all: Market Street is the really big road
with all the signs that say "Market Street".  Sometimes you have to
put down Google Maps and just use what little self awareness you
have at your disposal.

I met up with coworker Dave and we wandered around the city a bit,

In need of healing, I staggered over to Katayana Ramen - a boisterous

idea of running right now is equally hilarious and nauseating.

Due to my shyness, I dread every minute I spend outside my hotel
room.I'm tempted to spend all night poking around the Internet and
falling asleep under a bag of sunflower seeds.
</p>

<p>
The food is the only thing that gets me to step outside at night.I
quickly discovered that carefully planning meals and routes with
Google maps is not the way to experience the city.The information
isn't fresh, and most of the reviews are overly cynical.
</p>

<p>
Today, I downloaded a compass app onto my watch and ventured out
into the crisp night in search of Chinatown.I slipped into the
first restaurant that smelled like fish.

I don't remember the name of the place, but I can tell you that the
fish that ended up in my stir-fry was staring back at me through an
aquarium minutes before.

My fortune cookie reads, <i>The evening promises romantic interests</i>.
Since my wife isn't around, I don't see that coming true - unless
we're still talking about food.
</p>

<p>
The city is different.Nobody carries my favorite beer.The
streets are steep.I can't seem to find my hotel room on the first
try.But there is delicious food out there, and that is worth the
adventure.

There is a magical room at the end of the 2nd floor of the Zendesk
building called "Feather".Besides the comfy couches and video game
themed pillows, the entire wall facing the street is glass.With
all the interesting characters that stumble down market street, this
room is people watching paradise.

Don't worry, I'm not pretending to work.I got here a few minutes
early to catch up on the old blog.

<p>
Yesterday, Nick treated me and Dave to Vietnamese food.

<p>
That cup of bright orange liquid is <i>not</i> some kind of pumpkin
spiced latte.It's a Thai iced tea which was laced with enough
caffeine to restart somebody's heart.
</p>

<p>
After work I set out for the North East side once again in search of
<i>The Ramen Underground</i>.It's not very flashy, but I could tell my
the number of people waiting in line that I was onto something good.
I penned my name on a little whiteboard hanging on the window, then
waited outside for twenty minutes before I was led to a tiny seat at
the bar.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="old/images/ramen-underground.jpg" alt="ramen-underground.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
I ordered the house sake.The waitress brought me a shot glass in a
tiny wooden box, then overflowed the glass, letting the precious
sake I had purchased spill out.I panicked, and asked the family's
slack channel for advice.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I have a cultural emergency.I just ordered sake at a Ramen shop,
and they put the little shot glass in a wooden box and made it
overflow.Am I allowed to drink what's in the box, or will I look
like an idiot?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My wife did some research, and explained that this was the
traditional way to pour sake.It is a reflection on the
restaurant's generosity.And they <i>were</i> generous.

Was I supposed to be home in Wisconsin about six hours ago?
Absolutely.What am I still doing in a plane?I'll use that as my
cliffhanger.
</p>

<p>
Thursday was great.Dave and I had the last of our training
sessions, then ate lunch at a taco booth.Then after work, I met
the one and only Drew Hannay at my hotel for some rascally fun in
the city.
</p>

<p>
I pictured Drew being a cool San Francisco local that was ready to
whisk me away to a magical underground sushi restaurant, or show me
where the Twitter employees held their fight club.But Drew knew
San Francisco about as well as I did.His compass was more accurate
than mine, so at least he was kind of useful.
</p>

<p>
Drew and I plunked into another random Chinese restaurant and spent
the meal reminiscing about our college days.He reminded me of a
funny story.Around the time of our Freshman year, Google released
Chrome and, being the fanboy he was, Drew was trying to get everyone
in his dorm to adopt it.I was resistant to change, since I barely
knew how to use my computer and I didn't know how to migrate my
Safari bookmarks to anything else.
</p>

<p>
Drew found many creative ways to get Chrome in my dock, but I always
managed to delete it.Finally, he had checkmate when he installed
chrome and used OSX wizardry to give it the same icon as my beloved
Safari.I don't even think I realized it right away.I guess the
real punchline is that six years later, we're both Software
Engineers and we're chatting in a bar in the bay area.
</p>

<p>
I was touched that Drew drove all the way up from San Jose to eat
Chinese food and get lost in the Tenderloin with his old college
suite-mate.He's the real deal.
</p>

<p>
Friday is where things got kind of disorienting.I was awoken by an
automated call from American Airlines at 6 AM.The robocaller
mercillesly informed me that my flight has been canceled, and I was
to fly out at midnight.It's 3:45 AM right now, so by my watch, I
have about another six hours before I can see my family again.
</p>

<p>
Or who knows.Maybe I'll get another mysterious robocall telling me
that my connecting flight is canceled too.Maybe I'll have to live
at O'Hare permanently.

<p>
Finally home.I walked in my front door yesterday around 11 AM, and
I've basically been asleep since.To be honest, I don't even
remember being in O'Hare.At some point, I took a picture of this
sandwich, thinking it was a joke or something.

I think it's safe to say that traveling is out of my system.Two
connecting flights in twenty-four hours will do that to you, I
guess.Take a look at my map now!I worked hard to put that blip
there on the west coast.
