<br />
<span class="subtitle">Hoping to inspire a new attitude toward medication and mental health, my wife bravely shares her personal journey of discovering her anxiety disorder.</span>
</h1>
<p>
I have struggled with an anxiety disorder for almost three years. I
have only told a few people this until now. I have recently started to
be more open about my struggles, hoping that more people can
understand what anxiety really is and what struggling with it really
feels like. The stigma and misunderstandings of mental health
disorders are grossly incorrect. I’m going to share some of the
biggest highs and lows of my anxiety journey. I hope that you find it
enlightening and that it may help you relate to someone you know who
struggles with their mental health.

<h2 id="orgcf4853f">How it Started.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcf4853f">
<p>
In the summer of 2012 I traveled to Indonesia for a month through a
college program. I went with two other girls from my school and lived
with native Indonesians in cute little houses above the ocean for most
of the month I was there. I learned a lot from this trip, but it was
unexpectedly the event that brought about my anxiety disorder.
</p>


<div class="figure">

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Phoebe, Emma, and I at one of the houses we stayed in.</p>
</div>

<p>
When I returned home from my trip I complained to my mom about chest
pains, shortness of breath, and a strange tenseness. There were a
couple of moments where I felt like I couldn’t breath, so I went to
the ER. After several tests from basic cardiac tests to a CT scan
checking for blood clots from the long flight, the doctors found
nothing wrong with me. Now I was embarrassed for dragging my mom to
the ER and complaining about symptoms when there was nothing
wrong. Being a health major, my brain began thinking about the
hundreds of things that could be wrong with me that the hospital did
not check. During the rest of the summer the symptoms persisted and I
just moved on. I wasn’t exactly sure why this trip triggered my
anxiety disorder. I now think that it was the seclusion and distance
that caused me to think through several stressful life changes all at
once, leaving me overwhelmed and feeling abandoned. From the
disorganization along with excessive thinking about things back home,
my anxiety began.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1bfb778" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1bfb778">New Symptoms and a Changed Me.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1bfb778">
<p>
I went back to school for my sophomore year that fall and attempted to
continue with my studies. I noticed that I didn’t quite seem myself
and that things that were normally fun and easy for me like hanging
out with friends, being spontaneous, and being in large crowds in
general were increasingly difficult. I didn’t know what to think of
this new less-fun me, but I did my best to stifle my feelings and keep
moving on. Maybe a month or so into the fall semester I was in a study
room by myself in the science building and I had my first anxiety
attack.
</p>

<p>
What exactly is an anxiety attack? It is not just a moment of severe
nervousness, as most people think. It first feels like you have been
shocked in your heart, and then your body starts to shake
uncontrollably. Then you begin to sweat as your heart beats faster and
faster. You feel lightheaded and your vision changes for a few endless
minutes. After these few minutes, you come back from the attack and
are completely exhausted from the few minutes of intensity your body
just endured.
</p>

<p>
After this happened I called my mom terrified and told her what
happened. She then had an ah-ha moment. She told me that it sounded
like I had just had an anxiety attack and that she used to have
similar experiences when going on airplanes from having almost crashed
in a plane years ago.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so now everything is making more sense. This explains the
symptoms from the summer and my recent change in behavior.
</p>

<p>
“So, what now?”, I asked her. She wasn’t quite sure. She told me how
some people find relief in different ways like yoga, tea, and
meditation. Neither of us even had a thought about medication at this
point. I began my research and was pretty disappointed with the lack
of information that existed to help me.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="images/myAnxiousHeart.jpg" alt="myAnxiousHeart.jpg" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>My Anxious Heart by Katie Crawford</p>
</div>

<p>
My first thoughts were that I needed to just relax. “Take it easy,
you’re just stressed, you’ll get over it”, I told myself. This was a
big mistake. I felt that this is all I needed to do because of the
social stigma anxiety has.
</p>

<p>
Anxiety unfortunately doesn’t just go away without some work. Very
rarely is a phase that simply passes within a short amount of time. I
continued my fall semester trying to “relax” more and trying not to
let stress affect me as much. So because I wasn’t really doing
anything that directly could help my anxiety, my symptoms became worse
and worse. I had more panic attacks, I stayed home more, and did less
of what I enjoyed. My triggers began to become more and more obvious
to me as their effect on me grew. Large crowds were and still are a
big issue for me. This is for a reason that most people who don’t have
anxiety don’t understand. We aren’t afraid of crowds because we are
shy, a little more nervous, just want to be left alone, or are just
uncomfortable. The reason is much more odd and embarrassing.
</p>

<p>
For myself, I developed asthenophobia (fear of fainting) and
hypochondria (fear of becoming ill). I can’t explain why but this was
just part of my disorder and now it was part of me. So, when I would
be in large crowds I imagined myself passing out in the middle of
everyone and that absolutely terrified me for some reason. And this is
one of the worst parts of having anxiety: the Cycle. The more you
think and focus about the possibility of something happening the more
likely it is to actually happen. So the more I worry about passing out
in the middle of a large crowd the more likely it is that I will
actually pass out in a large crowd. The more you think about your
fears, the more afraid you become, and the more likely it is that
these fears will physically affect you.
</p>

<p>
This is the ugly truth about anxiety. We are afraid and embarrassed
about the real reasons behind our fear. We also become ashamed at what
silly things we have to do to avoid triggers or deal with stressful
moments. For example, for several months I had to leave our school
cafeteria by walking only along the wall of the room instead of
cutting through the middle of it. There were a few times where I
challenged myself, “just do it, you are so weird you can’t just walk
through there, just do it” and after reaching the end of the room my
heart would be racing, my head would feel light, and I would go home
as fast as possible to sit in my desk in a corner.

<p>
Okay so at this point I want to be clear that my entire story isn’t
scary and sad, it gets better - so stick with me.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge98c686">
<p>
I had one of my crowd anxiety attacks in the middle of chapel at
school when we all had to stand together to sing a song. Sounds
ridiculous, but it was torture to me. I spent those 45 minutes
completely overcome by my anxiety. One of the things that I hate most
about my anxiety is the voice in my head that I sometimes refer to as
the “anxiety monster”. During my anxious moments it’s like someone is
talking to me about all of the terrible things that could happen right
in that moment.
</p>

<p>
There were even times when I would just be walking around campus and
would begin to cry at some of the absolutely terrible things the
monster would tell me. So even though during that chapel service I
didn’t have a forty-five minute panic attack, I still was fighting a
personal battle. This was new to me and it was just too much.
</p>

<p>
I left chapel and went straight to our schools counseling center
trying to choke back tears. This was just too much, it’s too hard, I
needed help no matter how ashamed I was to ask for it. I went into the
counseling center and was immediately greeted with the most kind
smiling receptionist in the world, Betsy. I tried to maintain my
composure and ask her if I could schedule an appointment. She looked
at her screen and sadly told me that they were full but I could be on
a cancelation list. I put my name on the list and headed out to the
nearest bathroom to let out some tears.
</p>

<p>
Just as I was entering Betsy chased after me and said, “Oh Marissa! A
spot just opened for fifteen minutes from now, would you like to take
it?”. “YES”.
</p>

<p>
I still don’t know what would have happened if I had not been able to
get that spot in the counseling center. The timing couldn’t have been
more perfect. That day I started my two year journey with the Wheaton
College Counseling Center. I worked with a graduate student for the
remainder of the year and she was an absolute angel from God. I told
her all of my embarrassing moments and fears and worries and confusion
about what was going on. She would then tell me that it was okay and
that I wasn’t alone despite what I thought. She never judged me and
always knew what to say and what questions to ask.
</p>

<p>
Over the next few months she worked with me on understanding my
triggers and developing coping mechanisms to tackle the difficult
moments. One of the more complicated things that she helped me with
was stopping the anxiety spiral or the cycle as I referred to it
earlier. This was much more challenging than I had anticipated it
being. It’s almost like working with yourself in third person as your
own coach, “Okay that was good, but let’s try again”.
</p>

<p>
My therapy continued for several months into the spring semester. As
my counselor did help me with my existing challenges new anxiety
symptoms were arising left and right. We tackled them as they came but
I started to think that I may need more than just counseling to get me
through this. This was when I discovered two HUGE things that helped
me with my anxiety.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc26b6ff" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc26b6ff">1. Running</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc26b6ff">
<p>
Because of my hypochondria I was often worrying about my health. So
I began to think, hmm, I bet if I can run a couple of miles the
likelihood of me having this super rare random disease will be
lower (I know it sounds silly, but hey, we’ve gotta do what we’ve
gotta do). So I began running. Some were angry runs lashing out
against anxiety but they slowly became huge confidence and mood
boosters. I began running between three and five miles and day and
continued for about a half a year. This had a massive impact on my
anxiety and my confidence in my ability to conquer it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org79ca13f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org79ca13f">2. Alex</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org79ca13f">
<p>
Maybe a month or so after having started seeing my counselor I
decided to tell my new boyfriend at the time, Alex, that I had been
struggling with anxiety and had sought help with a counselor. I
waited so long to tell him because I felt ashamed, and I wanted him
to have a “normal” girlfriend not one who had to go see a
counselor. But we had been dating for a few months and I felt like
I could open up to him. So I sat him down and said that I needed to
tell him something and I told him my story. And he reacted in the
most perfect way possible, he gave me a long bear hug and said,
“How can I help”. Wow. I was not expecting that. His understanding
and willingness to learn about something completely new was a
testament of his love for me. I told him some of my triggers and
asked if he could help me when I am in and stressful situation and
we are together. He put in maximum effort to be my “safe person”
and still is today. He knows the drill if I give him a nudge and
say, “Hey I need your help”. He also went to counseling sessions
with me. That was huge. I think that it even made me feel better
about going to counseling that he was able to see that it wasn’t me
laying on a couch just talking about my relationships with various
family members. But it was more of a process of self
exploration. He continued to ask me how I was doing and show me how
much he cared by asking me questions like, “How was your anxiety
today” or “How did you do with _ situation?”. He still does this
and he is still my main supporter with my anxiety.

<h2 id="orgf01fcbe">Getting Better.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf01fcbe">
<p>
Things stayed about the same until my fall semester the following
year. I had a new counselor that year as my prior counselor had moved
on in her graduate school program. My new counselor was equally as
awesome and was able to help me with a new set of questions. At this
point I had been struggling with anxiety for over a year now. But my
symptoms still remained. I had a moment where I had to run out of a
class where I was demonstrating an anatomy concept because I was
closer than I had ever been to actually fainting from a panic
attack. My face went white, my knees were shaking and I was going
down.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully I sat down in time - but had never been more
embarrassed. So now I was back to the frustrated, angry person mad at
the world for giving her anxiety. I felt like I had tried
everything. But somehow I had missed the most obviously helpful option
of all - medication. I had avoided this because I felt that needing to
take a daily medication made me weak, dependent, and proved that I was
broken.
</p>

<p>
Looking back I realize how ridiculous this is. You wouldn’t look down
on someone taking daily medication for high blood pressure, right? So
why do people look down on needing to take medication for mental
health? It is no different that any other physical ailment you can
have. When you break your leg you go to the doctor, yet when you have
a panic attack, why does it seem intuitive to do nothing and figure it
out yourself?
</p>

<p>
This is because of a mental health stigma that exists in our society
that would need a whole additional blog post to talk about. So I began
my medication journey which was fairly simple compared to many other
stories I have heard. These are intense drugs with some pretty nasty
initial side effects so it often takes people a long trial and error
process to find the right medication for you. I started out with an
“as needed” drug Ativan. I took the smallest half milligram amount
whenever I felt like I was about to have an attach. It worked, I would
calm down but would feel really sleepy the rest of the day and then
have trouble sleeping when it was actually night time. The trick with
as needed medications is that they are considered as needed because
they can be addictive, or at least I know this to be true with my
Ativan. I was needing it more than a few times a week even though I
wasn’t craving it so I gave Zoloft a try. This is a daily
medication. I was nauseous and had significant vertigo for about two
weeks but after that I started to feel more like myself for the first
times in almost two years. I had to work a bit with finding the right
dose for me but I continued to take it and continued to find
significant relief. There is nothing wrong with taking medication to
help with mental health issues, rather there is something wrong with
being ashamed to try medication to help with mental health issue.

<p>
After graduating college and getting married I continued to take my
Zoloft but occasionally would take Ativan if I was particularly
anxious. Medication isn’t a cure but is a huge step in the direction
of being yourself again. I still struggle today. Particularly now
because I am off my medication while being pregnant. I think this is
why I wanted to write this blog now because I am reminded of how hard
living with anxiety really is.

I hope that my story may help you feel like you can relate more to a
loved one of your own struggling with a mental health
disorder. Patience, love, and lots of questions go a long way. We
aren’t crazy, we are just sick, and are trying to get better.
