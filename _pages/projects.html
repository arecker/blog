  <h2>Anti-Journal</h2>
  <p>
    Every Sunday to take a little break from writing, I publish some older
    selections from my private pre-b log journals, which I've aptly named
    <em>the Anti-Journal</em>.

  <h2>Saturday Morning Code</h2>
  <p>
    Tune in on late Saturday Mornings to watch me work on some code. I stream on
    YouTube and Facebook live.
