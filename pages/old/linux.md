When picking out a computer, most people see two obvious options -
Windows or Mac. But it takes a real geek to know the third
option. That third, mysterious option is _Linux_.

You see, long ago there was this system that nerds and scientists used
called Unix. These were computers that favored performance over user
friendliness. They were great for crunching numbers, collecting data,
and looking really cool on your desk.

The problem was they were expensive, and the software that came with
it was not very configurable. This all came to a head when a guy named
Richard Stallman set out to write his own version of every tool unix
had to offer - only his versions would be free and totally
customizeable.

Stallman was able to write a liberated copy of just about every unix
tool, all except for one important component - the kernel. This is the
routine of a computer that is responsible for allocating resources for
all the other programs. It is just as important as it sounds.

In great timing, a Finnish programmer by the name Linus Torlvalds
humbly offered up his makeshift kernel sideproject. He jokingly named
it Linux, a combination of "Linus" and "Unix". And so, there was born
the mysterious third option feared by Best Buy employees.

## The Best Kept Secret of Computing

So there is my incredibly informal history of Linux. I wasn't trying
to be accurate beyond re-gleaning a few wikipedia articles. If you are
into computer history, write your own summary and I promise I will
post it as an addendum.

For most of you click-and-close type of computer users out there, that
prequel was a gigantic turn off. Maybe I should have skipped it and
just said this: there is a third option. It's completely free, and if
you don't like anything about it, there are hundreds of other options
to choose from. Sound a little more appetizing?

Linux is really the best kept secret in computers. For people who do
know about it, they are usually only familiar with the really scary
parts, leading them to say things like _Weren't the guys who leaked
all those celbrity nudes using Linux_? They probably were, but they
probably also used the same butter you do on their toast that morning.

Linux gets a reputation for being built by and for the arrogant,
basement-dwelling recluses. But the reality is that you, dear reader,
are probably smart enough to figure it out.

## Why I use Linux

I have been using Linux for about three years now. The following are
the prevailing reasons why I have stuck with it.

### 1. Linux is Free

Linux is totally free. It's open source, which means the code is free
for anyone to take and edit. Not only can you [download] it, but you
can even _fork_ it. This means you can create your own version.

[download]: https://www.kernel.org/

If you wanted, you could literally publish your own version of Linux
under the name "Maroon5 Sucks OS", and I bet if you paid Google about
a trillion dollars, they would base the next version of Chrome OS off
of it and print "Maroon5 Sucks" right across the lid. But Google
probably wouldn't do this for anything short of a trillion dollars. As
it turns out, you are not as dependable of a maintainer as the people
who work on the official Linux kernel.

So why do those maintainers do it, especially when they don't always
get paid? In programming, "money' isn't the only form of money . There
is also time.

Let's say you have three teams of people that make competing
software. The bosses pay their engineers to build applications
profitable applications. The development of these applications will
take time.

Let's say that all three of these teams have to overcome a really
obnoxious problem - like accounting for timezones. This is code that
they will all have to write, test, and maintain. It also needs to be
perfectly accurate.

So why would all three teams write their own? Why not just share one
algorithm that they all test, contribute to, and maintain together?
That way they save time and get to focus on the stuff that is more
important to their bosses. Nobody gets paid for the code, but it makes
everyone's life a whole lot easier. They are paid in time .

This is how open source generally works. A bunch of people pitch in
and write something that makes everybody's life a lot easier. The
maintainers of the official Linux kernel keep at it because they need
it - and so do many other people.

This wonderful concept can trickle down to end users, even if they
will never write a line of code in their life. When you use Linux, you
can ride on the coat tails open source symbiosis - and the best part
of it all is that these programmers are delighted to have you along
for the ride. More users mean better testing. With your permission,
they can collect information from your machine and work on the errors
that you find. You, in exchange for free software, become an extreme
test case explorer.

twizzlers and watch cat videos for several hours straight.</p>

### 2. Linux is Customizeable

Have you ever downloaded an update and felt instantly depressed once
you saw the new changes to your favorite app or system? The biggest
example of this kind of upset that should be staring you in the face
is Windows 8. For whatever reason, Microsoft looked at the world's
most popular operating system and though, "Let's make the next version
totally unrecognizeable."

Don't get me wrong - some people like the giant tiles and bright
primary colors. That's not the point. My point is that if you want to
continue to use Windows, you have no choice but to live with
Microsoft's sometimes erratic design decisions.

In the land of Linux, the tables turn. When a distribution (i.e., a
flavor of Linux) release an update, it is done with great fear and
trembling. Why is that? It's because distribution maintainers know
that any poor design decisions on their part can cause an equal and
opposite exodus of faithful users.

Consequently, there are thousands of versions to choose from, and
fearing your dissatisfaction, most of them include plenty of ways to
customize your user experience.

There are versions that look really similiar to Windows.

<figure>
  <a href="/images/linux/mate.png">
    <img alt="linux mate" src="/images/linux/mate.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

There are versions that look _exactly_ like Windows.

<figure>
  <a href="/images/linux/windowslookalike.jpg">
    <img alt="linux windowslookalike" src="/images/linux/windowslookalike.jpg"/>
  </a>
</figure>

There are versions that look like something out of the control room of
Jurassic Park.

<figure>
  <a href="/images/linux/next.png">
    <img alt="linux next" src="/images/linux/next.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

There are versions that look exactly like your mom's Mac.

<figure>
  <a href="/images/linux/pearOS.png">
    <img alt="linux pearOS" src="/images/linux/pearOS.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

There are versions that are look like a combination of Mac and
Windows.

<figure>
  <a href="/images/linux/kde.png">
    <img alt="linux kde" src="/images/linux/kde.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

And there are versions that look like a whole different animal all
together.

<figure>
  <a href="/images/linux/ubuntu1204.png">
    <img alt="linux ubuntu1204" src="/images/linux/ubuntu1204.png"/>
  </a>
</figure>

The point is you never have to be a sucker for someone else's
opinion. If you believe that the last good looking computer was made
in 1991, you can use that look forever. If you like to use something
different every day, you can make changes on the fly. You can switch
the clock to army time, change the color of the window's shadows, and
even use a little picture of your dog as the mouse cursor. The choices
in Linux are unlimited.

### 3. Linux is Organized

Everyone has their own software preferences. Remind yourself of your
own, then imagine yourself setting up a fresh new Windows or Mac
computer.

1. Open Safari or Internet Explorer (make sure you wash your hands
   after). Go to Firefox's website. Download installer, open, and
   follow the instructions.
2. Go to VLC's website. Download installer, open, and follow the
   instructions.
3. Go to GIMP's website. Download installer, open, and follow the
   instructions.
4. Go to Thunderbird's website. Download installer, open, and follow
   the instructions.

The pattern is inevitably tedious. Even worse, the only way you are
going to know these applications need to be updated is faith that they
will individually nag you the next time you open them. The whole
system is ecclectic at best and a mess at worst.

In Linux, a beautiful thing called package management is used. If you
don't know what it is now, it's about to become your new favorite
thing. All the software available for the system comes from one
source. Therefore, if you want to install anything new, you only need
to visit one place. Most versions of Linux make it look really pretty
and browsable, but the reality is that installing anything takes only
one command.

In Ubuntu (a popular version of Linux), performing the above steps
would look like this:

``` shell
sudo apt-get install firefox vlc gimp thunderbird
```

Abracadabra. The applications are totally removed and they are no
longer rolled into your software updates.

Package management is one of those things that you can never stop
using once you figure out how to use it. If you have an obsessive need
to keep things clean and organized in your workspace, switching to
Linux would be worth it for the package management alone. I even keep
a giant list of all my favorite software on hand. That way, if I ever
want to do some spring cleaning of my system and start from scratch, I
just run a script - and by the time I've made a sandwich and come
back, I have all of my favorite software installed on my machine.

### 4. Linux is Fun

This reason is much more subjective than the others. Getting to
customize anything I want on my computer makes using my computer more
fun. I'll be honest, sometimes I go a little crazy and break
something. I'll install a theme or plugin that wasn't quite ready for
the general public, and now I can't boot into my desktop. But you just
have to make reasonable preparations if you are going to go off of the
beaten path and do some ricing (customization). Keep backups, read
things before you do them, don't start anything big too late at night,
and never drink around blank DVD's. I've personally coined the term
drunk partition . This is when you wake up next to a bottle of Honey
Jack with a new hard drive partition that you don't recognize and a
DVD with a handwritten label that says "FREEBSD lol ;)".

Don't get me wrong - there are plenty of means in the Linux community
to set up something simple and dependable and mind your own
business. But for whatever reason, most of us take weird pleasure in
breaking our machine and learning about our system by fixing it.

## Good Reasons Why Not to Use Linux

One of the biggest things that scared me about switching to Linux was
the difference in software. To be honest, switching would not be
helpful if your life depends on really expensive and/or exclusive
software.

If you are a graphic designer and you pretty much spend all day in
Adobe Photoshop, keep using whatever you are using. There is no easy
way to use Photoshop in Linux.

However, if you just need something to resize pictures, turn a few of
your camera phone shots into artsy black and white expressions, or
shop a Hitler moustache onto your baby, [GIMP] totally gets the job
done.

[GIMP]: http://www.gimp.org/

If you live your whole life out of iTunes and liken your Apple ID to
your social security number, stay on a Mac. It wouldn't really make
sense for you to switch.

However, if you just need something to roll through your big fat
folder of mp3s or play your home videos, there are tons of options for
media players in Linux.

If you know the Microsoft Office suite better than you know your
family and you are an absolute virtuoso in Microsoft excel, stick with
Windows. However, if you just need something to crank out essays and
make decent lab reports, [LibreOffice] is a great replacement.

[LibreOffice]: http://www.libreoffice.org/

There is always the Google option too. Linux run Google Chrome like a
champ, so if you spend most of your time in Drive, Google Play,
YouTube, Gmail, and Hangouts, you will feel right at home.

One category of people that used to fall into this section was PC
gamers. But the tides are turning, reader. Last year, the popular
Gaming client Steam became available for Linux, and in only one year
more than 800 games have been produced for Linux. It still pales in
comparison to what's out for Windows, but Gabe Newell has clearly
outlined his intention to move the future of PC gaming to Linux.

Lastly, you shouldn't use Linux if you don't know how to search the
Internet for answers. Many Linux users would probably scream at me for
saying this, but there is no official help for Linux (that is, a
single Linux company you can call). Some people just need the comfort
of knowing they can call Microsoft and, after an hour of sitting on
hold, talk to someone who is paid by the people who make their
computer.

There's no official place to get help, but there are literally
thousands of places online where people want to help you for fun.

Once of my favorite places to get help has been the [Linux4Noobs]
subreddit, which offers their help in anything - from general
questions to utter disaster recovery.

[Linux4Noobs]: http://reddit.com/r/linux4noobs

There is also the [Arch Linux Wiki], which serves as a freely edited
instruction manual. Though it is written for the Arch Linux
distribution, many Linux users consult it when they need something
technically detailed.

[Arch Linux Wiki]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/

But above all, Google is your friend. Most errors in Linux can be
resolved by just pasting the error message into Google and reading the
first result. In my opinion, that beats the socks off of any official
customer support help line.

## How to Try Linux

Don't worry. In this section, we're not going to do anything
serious. I'm going to tell you how to try out Linux, but also assume
that you have massive issues with commitment. No one is commiting to
anything here.

Before I lay out my recommended ways of trying out Linux, I'd first
like to nip a particularly bad way in the butt. If you've looked into
this before, you have probably come across dual booting .

Dual booting is when you install two operating systems on one
computer. When you power of your computer, you select which system you
want to start.

Dual booting is a bad idea - especially if you are a beginner. I know
it seems like a reasonable transition into Linux, but you will just be
making it harder to use Linux and whatever was already on your
computer. I've tried just about everything, and have returned to tell
you that dual booting is not as fun as people make it
sound. Additionally, it just makes people's first impressions of Linux
worse than they could be.

Now that we have had a family chat about the dangers of dual booting ,
here is how you can try Linux (and keep your serious issues with
commitment in tact).

### 1. Use a Live CD

Computers can "boot off of" things other than themselves. I like to
think of it like putting your car up on a jack. You can temporarily
have your computer live off of a CD, SD card, or USB while it sets
your hard drive aside.

This is a great way to try Linux. You can create a CD, which will
almost always give you the option of just trying it out before you
install.

The hardest part about doing this is that you have to burn the CD
yourself. Here's how it will go:

1. Download a Linux image. This will be a file that ends in
   ".iso". Most of them are pretty big, so it may take a while. Here
   is a link to [Ubuntu's download page].
2. Grab a blank CD or DVD. You are going to want to burn the iso to
   the disc. Both Mac and Windows usually have built in utilites to do
   this, but if you are not sure how, now would be a good time to
   prime your Google-Fu . Make sure you burn it as slowly as possible.
3. Insert the disc into your drive. Wait until it registers, then
   power down your computer. Once it is completely off, power it back
   on. If you have Windows, follow the instructions in your boot
   screen (it's usually one of the f keys) until you find a place
   where you can select the disc. If you are on a Mac, hold down the
   alt key and wait until the disc become available to select. Bear in
   mind, it's been a while since I have done this. The boot process
   may be different for each computer, but it's easy to find (even if
   this has to be your last call to geeksquad ever).
4. You should see the purple splash screen. Ubuntu will present you
   with two options - Install, or try it out. I think it's clear which
   you should pick.
5. Once you are done playing around in Ubuntu, power down, then power
   back on without doing anything. You should be back in your own
   system, where you can remove the disc and pretend none of this ever
   happened (unless you enjoyed it).

[Ubuntu's download page]: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop

### 2. Virtualization

Virtualization is a need little trick. Without ever turning off your
computer, you can launch a tiny virtual computer in a window. Given,
it won't be as powerful, but it's a great way to try something out in
a truly isolated sandbox.

I like to use [VirtualBox]. It's free, and pretty dependable. Download
the software and the ISO mentioned above and create a new virtual
machine. While setting up, you will load the ISO file into the virtual
dvd drive of your virtual machine. Once you are set up, you can play
and pause it like a VCR. All of the happenings of this dangerous Linux
experiment will be contained to a little window on your computer. Once
you are done, you can power it down and delete it.

### 3. An Old Computer

Get an old computer. Linux can run on pretty much anything, especially
a $50 craigslist laptop or your dad's old PC.

## In Conclusion

I hope now, reader, that you can rid yourself of the notion that Linux
is for super elite hackers. Truthyfully, Linux is for just about
anyone that knows how to operate a computer, doesn't mind learning
something new, and likes to pick their own colors. There are literally
[hundreds of thousands] of distros to try. If you have some freetime,
pick up a pack of blank DVDs and take the first 25 that look
interesting to you. Now go have an adventure.
