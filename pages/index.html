    <h3>The Streak is Broken!</h3>
    <p>After 672 consecutive days of blogging, I finally took a day off!  In fact, I liked it so much that I might start taking off regularly on Sunday nights.  It was fun while it lasted.</p>

    <h3>Projects Page</h3>
    <p>Special entries like "looking back on" and "anti-journal" are now automatically aggregated on the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page!</p>

    <h3>Where are the archives?</h3>
    <p>Don't panic - the archives have moved! They are safe and sound over at <a href="https://github.com/arecker/archive">arecker/archive</a>. Thanks to the good folks at Netlify, the original links are being redirected as well.</p>
