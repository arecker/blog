    <h2>What's New?</h2>
    <h3>The Streak is Broken!</h3>
    <p>After 672 consecutive days of blogging, I finally took a day
    off!  In fact, I liked it so much that I might start taking off
    regularly on Sunday nights.  It was fun while it lasted.</p>
    <h3>Projects Page</h3>
    <p>
      Special entries like "looking back on" and "anti-journal" are now
      automatically aggregated on the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page!
    </p>
    <h3>Where are the archives?</h3>
    <p>
      Don't panic - the archives have moved! They are safe and sound over at
      <a href="https://github.com/arecker/archive">arecker/archive</a>. Thanks
      to the good folks at Netlify, the original links are being redirected as
      well.
